Asteroid Blues

A rainy street. A thin, puffy-haired man named Spike Spiegel smokes a cigarette. A rose falls into a puddle. A shoot out in a dark building. A wicked smile.

OPENING CREDITS

Session #1: ASTEROID BLUES

Hyperspace rings over Mars. An old fishing ship called the Bebop flies through hyperspace. Spike practices martial arts in the dark. A brawny, bald man named Jet Black tosses bell peppers in a wok.

JET: Hey, Spike! It's ready!

SPIKE: I'm just about done myself. What's cooking?

JET: Special, "Qing-jiao-rou-si." (Beef with bell peppers)

The living room.

JET: Asimov Solensan. This is our next target.

SPIKE: Hey, Jet...

JET: He's a high-end of the syndicate that deals all around the asteroids.

SPIKE: About this "Qing-jiao-rou-si..."

JET: This guy's name is Asimov Solensan. Weren't you listening to me?!

SPIKE: You DON'T call a meatless "beef with bell peppers" "beef with bell peppers"... do you?

JET: Yes, you do.

SPIKE: No, you don't!

JET: You do when you're broke!

SPIKE: What happened to the 1 million Woolongs we got as bounty from that last guy?!

JET: The repair bill the plane you wrecked and the repair bill for the shop you trashed and the medical bill for the cop you injured KILLED ALL THE DOUGH!

Silence.

JET: Three days ago, there was a shootout between his group and an enemy syndicate. He killed his own men, and took off. They say he's hiding with his woman in Tijuana.

SPIKE: That's a place for nobodies to go.

JET: Despite being a nobody, he's worth 2.5 million.

SPIKE: Don't fell like it.

JET: Tijuana... The beef there is REALLY tasty...

The exit of the hyperspace rings. Recorded voices in different languages begin to speak.

RECORDED VOICES: Attention, please. We will soon arrive at the gate. We look forward to serving you again. Please line up single file at the tollbooth after clearing the gate. Please pass by after switching the credit sensors to debit mode.

A digital receipt for 7500 Woolongs.

On the Bebop.

JET: I'll head over after hitting the cops for clues.

SPIKE: Then I'll try seeing old man Bull.

JET: Can you trust that old buy?

Spike starts up his red fighter craft, Swordfish II, whistling a sad little tune. Swordfish rolls out, its wings fold down.

JET: Such an easygoing song.

Jet turns off the magnet on the deck. Swordfish floats off the deck and blasts off.

Tijuana. Ships and cars zoom by the crowded streets. A man chases two boys carrying large paper bags.

MAN: THEIF!

A bar called "El Rey." Three senile old men, Antonio, Carlos and Jobin, play poker. The bartender cleans a glass.

ANTONIO: This again? Goddamn sonofabitch! Man, you're totally ripping me off, but do ya realize the reason you can live here is because I dug that gate with all my might, ya hear?

CARLOS: This again. You always say that when you lose. We all dug the gate together, remember?

JOBIN: That we did... We dug like there was no tomorrow...

ANTONIO: Goddamn idiot sonofabitch...

Asimov and his girlfriend, Katerina, enter. Katerina appears to be pregnant.

ASIMOV: Gimme a beer.

KATERINA: And I'll have a Bloody Mary.

BARTENDER: I got vodka, but unfortunately I'm out of tomato juice.

ASIMOV: I'm sure there's ONE CAN in the back room...

Asimov flashes a vile of eye spray from his coat.

BARTENDER: I'll take a look.

The bartender and Asimov walk into the back room.

A blue car pulls up. Several men walk out toting guns.

The back room.

ASIMOV: Top notch "RED-EYE." You'd know, as a buyer, right?

BARTENDER: Can it be... "BLOODY-EYE?"

Outside. The men surround the building.

The back room. The bartender tosses Asimov a spray mechanism.

BARTENDER: Prove to me that it's the real thing.

Asimov sprays his eyes.

ASIMOV: Keep those eyes open!

The bartender is shot in the head. The old men hide under a table. The room is littered with glass and debris. Katerina returns fire behind the corner of the counter. Asimov dodges bullets and kills the men.

A tent somewhere on Mars. A tribesman, Laughing Bull sifts sand through the palm of his hand. Spike watches impatiently.

SPIKE: This is dandy, but you got anything to eat?

Silence.

SPIKE: I see.

BULL: The red-eyed coyote will appear at the north end of town. That is what I see.

SPIKE: A red-eyed coyote, huh...

BULL: You, "Swimming Bird." You shall meet a woman. You shall be targeted by that woman... and... death.

SPIKE: Again, I see.

BULL: "Again"?

SPIKE: I've already died once. Got killed by a woman.

BULL: You take women too lightly.

SPIKE: Catch ya later.

Spike exits.

BULL: May he be blessed by Wakantanka.

The mess at "El Rey." The cat licks a puddle on the floor. Jet enters and picks up a bottle from behind the counter.

JET: Presidente? I'll have a glass on the house.

A car pulls in. Two thugs enter. Jet hides.

THUG A: Damn. Asimov sure lost his head.

THUG B: No shit. We gotta do something before the cops start moving.

THUG A: Ya wanna leave it to the cops? He IS using those eyedrops. There's no way we can win.

THUG B: I'm tellin' ya, we got nothin' if we don't get that "BLOODY-EYE" back.

THUG A: But, man...!

Jet taps a Thug B on the shoulder.

JET: Hey.

Jet smashes the bottle over Thug B's head. Jet puts Thug A in a headlock and puts the broken bottle near his face.

JET: Can you give me specifics?

The Swordfish flies over farmland.

SPIKE: Man, I'm hungry...

The control panel flashes "EMPTY."

SPIKE: You too...?

A public men's room. Spike enters a stall. Asimov enters.

Outside. Katerina buys food from vending machines.

Asimov retches in a sink. Spike exits the stall and washes his hands at the sink next to Asimov. Asimov reaches into his coat for a gun.

SPIKE: It's better to leave the water running. Or it'll clog.

Spike exits, whistling.

EYECATCH

Outside the public men's room. Spike bumps into Katerina, spilling her bag. Spike picks the food off the ground.

KATERINA: Oh, I'm sorry!

Spike puts a few items into her bag.

KATERINA: Thank you...

Spike starts walking away.

KATERINA: Um...

Spike turns around, mouth full and pulls a hotdog out of his mouth.

SPIKE: I'm sorry.

KATERINA: Ew! I don't want that anymore! You can have it!

SPIKE: Lucky!

Spike pulls out more items from his jacket. Katerina smiles. Asimov enters from a corner and spots them.

SPIKE: I'm really sorry, honest. Felt like my stomach was going to be glued to my back.

They laugh.

Fuel station. Spike refuels the Swordfish.

KATERINA: Nice fighter.

SPIKE: It's an old model. She's been with me for over ten years.

KATERINA: Looks like you've gotten a lot of use out of it.

SPIKE: I travel around a lot.

Spike twirls a cigarette between his fingers.

SPIKE: I'm actually a wandering performer.

KATERINA: I can't tell if you're for real or just joking.

SPIKE: A lot of people say that about me.

KATERINA: Been to Mars yet?

SPIKE: I was born on Mars.

KATERINA: They have everything there. Unlike here, Mars has lots of people, lots of things. They must live happily there.

SPIKE: Only the rich.

KATERINA: Then I'm sure we'll be happy there.

SPIKE: Your planning on escaping to Mars? Running away... but how far can you go?

KATERINA: Who are you?

SPIKE: An old-fashioned cowboy.

KATERINA: A bounty hunter?

SPIKE: Good call.

KATERINA: You're not going to catch us?

SPIKE: Your buddy seems pretty ill. I don't deal with weakened nobodies.

KATERINA: Wise decision.

Asimov chokes Spike from behind him.

ASIMOV: YOU are the nobody!

KATERINA: Asimov! That's enough!

Asimov lets go, Spike reaches into Asimov's coat as he falls to the ground. Asimov and Katerina drive away. 

KATERINA: Adios, cowboy.

On the road.

ASIMOV: Why did you stop me? I coulda killed him in one second.

KATERINA: You're tired. If you don't do this anymore...

ASIMOV: He was young and attractive.

KATERINA: I was waiting so long for you to come pick me up... I can finally escape the low life I've had here... I can finally live happily on Mars.

Jet's shadow looms over Spike.

JET: A nap. How peaceful.

Spike opens his eyes.

SPIKE: I had a good dream.

JET: That's great. Then you can see the rest of that dream on the Bebop. I'm giving up on this one. It's impossible to catch him. There's no way we can win. When Asimov left his syndicate he snuck something out with him. The top-end stuff of all the illegal eyedrops that the syndicate makes. He took off with all of the drops, so the group is in a mess. They wanna catch him, but all they get back are corpses. Because Asimov is using it... The eyedrops known as "BLOODY-EYE."

Spike twirls Asimov's eyedrop vile between his fingers.

SPIKE: They're planning to go to Mars.

JET: Mars?

SPIKE: But before that, they'll sell THIS off.

JET: Hmm? That's...

SPIKE: I grabbed it from his breast pocket.

JET: You... met him?

SPIKE: A nightmare.

JET: He got you?

SPIKE: The red-eyed coyote will supposedly appear at the north end of town.

In space, police ships surround Tijuana.

A police car zooms by Asimov and Katerina's parked car. They exit.

Denis Bar. The three old men play cards at a table. Antonio throws down his cards.

ANTONIO: This again? Goddamn sonofabitch! Man, you're totally rippin' me off, but do ya realize the reason you can eat well around here is because I cultivated the land with my buddies, ya here?

CARLOS: Yeah, and that's us.

JOBIN: That we did... We planted those seeds like there was no tomorrow...

CARLOS: You were always planting "seeds" of a different kind, though!

Asimov and Katerina walk by. Asimov sits down next to a Spike disguised in poncho and sombrero.

ASIMOV: You have any Bloody Marys?

SPIKE: I only got beer.

ASIMOV: I've got tomato juice.

SPIKE: How much?

ASIMOV: 300,000 Woolongs. I got 50 packs.

SPIKE: 15 million Woolongs...

ASIMOV: I'm in a hurry. I'll find others if you don't want it.

SPIKE: Show me.

Asimov reaches into the coat and finds that the vile is missing. Spike holds up the vile.

SPIKE: Lookin' for this? Hey, do you know what YOU are worth?

ASIMOV: What?

SPIKE: Only 2.5 million Woolongs. You're such a cheap guy.

Spike takes off the sombrero.

SPIKE: Long time no see.

ASIMOV: Since when are you a buyer? Did you give up on bounty hunting?

SPIKE: No thrill in cheap bounties.

ASIMOV: Looks like you do better as a thief. Give it back.

SPIKE: Sure I will. I owe you one!

Spike tosses the vile into the air and shoots it with his gun. He rushes
into, dodges his blows and beats him up.

SPIKE: You trust your eyes too much! You're not a chameleon!

Spike takes off the poncho.

SPIKE: You can't see everywhere all at once!

Spike continues to beat him up. Katerina points a gun at them, hands shaking. A black fighter shoots from the air. They run for cover.

ASIMOV: Let's go!

Gangsters in a car chase Asimov and Katerina.

GANGSTER: That way!

Spike chases after the car.

GANGSTER: That way! That way!

Spike climbs to the roof of the car and proceeds to beat up the gangsters who reach for him through the windows.

Katerina points her gun at a man refueling his ship.

KATERINA: Don't move! All right. stay still!

Asimov boards the man's ship. Gunfire from above rips a hole in Katerina's dress near her belly. Viles of eye spray fall from the hole. She struggles to retrieve the viles. Katerina boards the ship.

ASIMOV: IDIOT! We're doomed if this breaks! Be more careful!

Gangsters in cars pull up and open fire on Spike. Spike leaps behind the car. The two cars are lifted by the Jet's fighter, the Hammerhead.

JET: Sorry to keep you waiting.

SPIKE: You're late, Jet!

Spike sees Asimov and Katerina take off in the stolen ship.

SPIKE: Shit!

Two black fighters chase and shoot at them.

Inside the stolen ship, Asimov is trembling.

KATERINA: Asimov.

The Swordfish takes off and guns down the black fighters. The Swordfish chases after the stolen ship.

In the stolen ship. Asimov holds a vile of eye spray to his eyes.

KATERINA: Stop! Doing any more is insane! Don't do it!

The chase continues in space. Katerina sees the police ships.

KATERINA: We can't run anymore... There is no way we can get away...

A loud gunshot.

Spike flies next to the stolen ship. Katerina has shot Asimov in the head.

KATERINA: Adios...

The police ships completely shred the stolen ship with gunfire. Katerina floats in space, the viles of eye drops flow out of the hole in her dress.

The Bebop. Jet tosses bell peppers in his wok.

JET: Hey, Spike, it ready!

The control room.

JET: It's ready.

SPIKE: What's cooking?

JET: SPECIAL, "Qing-jiao-rou-si."

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

CLOSING CREDITS

COMING EPISODE

SPIKE: Well, and so this program is finally under way.

JET: What's the meaning of all this?

SPIKE: Next week, we're completely changing gears to show an anime for all ages.

JET: Was it that kind of a story?

SPIKE: Cheerful animals wreak havoc all over!

JET: WHAT?!

SPIKE: But Dr. Doolittle WON'T be making an appearance. From little kids to the elderly, if you love animals...

JET: Hey, hold on now, Spike!

SPIKE: Everyone gather around and watch the show!

JET: Is it alright to say stuff like that!? I'm not responsible for anything!

SPIKE: But there is one favor to ask right now. Good little kids should sit far from the TV when watching this show.

JET: Come on...

SPIKE: Stand back about a kilometer.

JET: That's TOO far.

SPIKE: 800 meters then?

OPENING CREDITS

A group of thugs approach the entrance. Faye loads a machine gun.

FAYE: Ya know the first rule in combat?

Session #3
HONKY TONK WOMEN

A ship floating above Mars. A casino owner named Gordon holds Faye in custody.

GORDON: I didn't know that the sure-shot and master of poker, the legendary Poker Alice, was still alive.

FAYE: If she was still alive, she'd be 219 years old now.

GORDON: Of course. You sure don't look over 200. Besides, Alice never lost during her lifetime. She kept winning, without cheating.

FAYE: You have a way to prove that?

GORDON: I hear your carrying a large debt.

He pulls an ace card from Faye's shorts.

GORDON: Which do you prefer - the police or my establishment?

A casino called Spiders From Mars floating in Mars space. Spike, cigarette in mouth, and Jet are on an elevator.

SPIKE: A prophecy?

JET: Charlie said, "Only hands can wash hands. If you want to receive, you must first give." Hey, doesn't that mean that Charlie is telling us to just do it? Right?

SPIKE: Do you think Charlie Parker would quote Goethe?

JET: Oh come on, it's all part of the dream I had.

SPIKE: The way things go, I say that even the hard-earned 5000 woolongs will disappear with your dream.

JET: Let me tell you something, Spike. This is a no smoking area.

Jet points to a "No Smoking" sign. Spike swallows the cigarette. They enter the casino.

JET: You shouldn't play. Your eyes are too good for this. They'll kick us out if you win too much.

SPIKE: Then don't bring me here.

Spike spits the cigarette into the garbage.

Jobin, Antonio and Carlos play at a table. Antonio is reluctant to flip his card. Spike approaches and taps the card three times.

SPIKE: Pray, man.

Antonio flips the card and wins a large cache of chips. Spike takes a small handful.

SPIKE: I'll take one.

Jet scores at a slot machine.

Faye deals at a blackjack table.

FAYE: Small-jack.

Spike sits down.

SPIKE: I'll play a few.

Faye looks down at a monitor with bad reception displaying a man in a blue suit.

FAYE: Must be him.

Spike wins a hand.

FAYE: Nice, Jackie.

Earlier on Gordon's ship.

GORDON: The target will sit at the blackjack table and lose at a certain point. Of course, you will help him with that. And he will hand you the last chip he has as a dealer's chip.

FAYE: And what about it?

GORDON: It's something that'll make your dept as small as 1 tiny second in this universe.

Back at the blackjack table.

FAYE: Last game.

SPIKE: I'm not lucky nor am I nimble.

FAYE: Then what are you?

SPIKE: Generous.

Faye wins the hand.

FAYE: Blackjack.

SPIKE: Ya got me. I give up.

He holds up his last chip.

SPIKE: I'll take this as a memento.

Spike leaves.

FAYE: Huh? Wait a minute! Hold up!

Faye runs after Spike.

Spike bumps into a man in a blue suit. Both drop their chips. The man scrambles on the floor and picks up Spike's chip. Under Spike's shoe is the man's chip. Spike picks it up. Faye catches up.

FAYE: Hey, you! What part of you is generous? This wasn't the plan I heard! I thought you were supposed to give me the last chip!

SPIKE: Why should I? I played along with you and your cheats!

Spectators are alerted.

MAN A: Did ya hear that?! Cheating!

MAN B: That for real?

WOMAN: The dealer has been cheating!

Spike swallows the chip.

Security guards approach Spike. Faye runs away.

GUARD A: Can you come with me to the office?

SPIKE: Why?

The guard punches Spike.

SPIKE: What do you want?

Spike knocks him out.

GAURD B: You piece of...!

Spike dodges his blow and knocks him out. Several more guards appear.

SPIKE: Come on. Does this casino also run a fitness club?

Faye activates her fighter, the Red Tail, with her bracelet.

FAYE: It's showtime!

Spike beats all the guards. Jet emerges from the crowd holding a large box of coins.

JET: Heh heh. Pardon me here.

Jet sees Spike beat up more guards.

JET: Spike...

The Red Tail flies through the casino.

FAYE: All right.

The fighter lands in front of Faye.

Spike spots Jet.

SPIKE: Jet.

JET: That's why I told you not to...

SPIKE: That's not it! But we gotta split!

JET: I haven't cashed these in yet!

GAURDS: HEY!!

They run away.

Faye boards the Red Tail, blasts open the windows of the casino and jets off. She sees Spike and Jet hugging the windshield of the Red Tail and screams.

In a dark room. The man in the blue suit is beaten to a pulp.

THUG A: He doesn't have it. The chip is a fake.

GORDON: Neither you nor your boss realize why we cooked up this whole thing... If that chip falls into police hands it's all over!

THUG B: Boss, we still can't find that broad.

GORDON: Find her! Put a reward on her if you have to.

Gordon shoots the man three times.

EYECATCH

The Bebop parked outside the casino. The bathroom. Faye is cuffed to the toilet.

FAYE: Wait a sec! Why is my reward for bringing ya back being trapped in here?!

The data dog named Ein approaches Faye.

JET: I see. She smells like money to you too, huh?

FAYE: You have GOT to be kidding!

SPIKE: Jet, how much did you have?

JET: Oh, 200K. Easy.

SPIKE: And who put it all to naught?

FAYE: What, only 200K? That's nothing compared to my debt... Besides, don't you think this is a bit much for a false accusation?

SPIKE: Well, that mono-carrier should sell for about 400K.

FAYE: If you had just given me that chip, we wouldn't have had a problem.

JET: Chip?

FAYE: Yeah!

Spike regurgitates the chip.

JET: Disgusting.

FAYE: If you give that to Gordon, he'll give you as much as you want. Yeah, let's do that!

SPIKE: I don't know any guy named Gordon nor do I want to believe your stories.

Spike walks away.

FAYE: Wait a minute!

JET: Let's go, Ein.

Jet closes the door. He and Ein walk away.

FAYE: Are you listening to me? Come on!

Faye reaches into her suit for a communicator.

The living room. Jet taps on the keyboard.

JET: It's a chip.

SPIKE: Of course it's a chip.

JET: I didn't mean that kind of chip. There's a microchip in this thing.

Spike tunes into Big Shot.

PUNCH: AMIGO! Leave it to us for bounty information!

JUDY: Thanks for waiting! It's time for BIG SHOT!

In the bathroom. Faye adjusts the communicator.

The living room.

JET: This is...

JUDY: So, first up this week is...?

PUNCH: It's a shame we have to hand her to the police. She doesn't look it, but she's a real mean one. Faye Valentine.

JET: Hey, Spike!

JUDY: The bounty is a whooping 6 million! A real deal!

SPIKE: Hey, Jet!

PUNCH: First come, first served!

JUDY: Good luck. cowboys!

Gordon's ship.

GORDON: I've been waiting for you.

FAYE: First off, let me tell you that I didn't intend to run.

GORDON: I trust you. Where are you?

FAYE: An old fishing ship in the gate. They have the chip. So hurry up and-

Faye is cut off.

Bebop's bathroom. The door opens.

FAYE: What?

JET: We thought we were being immature. To leave a young woman in a place like this.

FAYE: You aren't thinking weird thoughts, are you?

JET: No, we thought we'd escort you to a place more considerate of your situation.

FAYE: On, and where would that be?

SPIKE AND JET: The police.

JET: We're sorry that we were so cheap earlier with the 200K bit, Faye Valentine.

FAYE: What, there's a bounty out on me?

SPIKE: A whopping 6 million.

FAYE: What... only 6 million?

JET: How much are you in debt...?

FAYE: Come on, please! Anywhere but the police.

JET: Only the police would give us money.

FAYE: My mother's last will was for me to not be in any place for too long!

SPIKE: Yeah, yeah...

FAYE: My family have always been "Romanies," wandering about in search of love. You don't know anything, do you? That's another term for Gypsies! Everyone else, like you guys, with no pride in their lives are called "Gorgio."

SPIKE: I'm fine with being a "Gorgio."

Faye calls out. Ein howls.

FAYE: It's calling me... The great outdoors are calling out to me...

JET: You can do all of this with the cops.

SPIKE: Let's go, Jet.

FAYE: Oh, fine. I won't run. At least untie one hand! I can't even go to the bathroom like this!

JET: Man, we got one yappy woman here...

The control room.

JET: Like taking candy from a baby.

SPIKE: More like a small sacrifice for a large reward.

JET: Charlie said, "If you want to receive, you must first give." I guess what I see in dreams is worth something once in a while...

Gordon's ship pushes on top of the Bebop.

SPIKE: What do you think you're doing?

GORDON: I don't know who you are but I would like the chip back.

SPIKE: I don't know who you are but I refuse.

GORDON: It's just a chip that means nothing to you.

JET: Although we can sell what's IN the chip for a pretty penny. There was a decryption program called Crypt-Breaker that was developed by SIT three years ago. Rumors say that right after its completion, the programmer was killed and the program went into the black market. It's a "magic key" that can decode and unlock almost every protection code. But that program itself was encoded. So there was a need to find the key to open the program. I heard rumors that both the cops and the ISSP were parting hairs to find the key... I never thought I would see it in a place like this.

GORDON: Your pretty good.

JET: I used to work in a shady place called the ISSP. I'm sure the casino was to take attention away from the large sum of money and to fool the cops. You just chose the wrong day. Of course, this thing is useless for us as well. I would only be proper to give it to the cops.

GORDON: I'll play.

JET: 300 million... Nah, too much. How about 30 million? Not bad for the price of a magic key, eh?

GORDON: All right...

The bathroom. Faye uncuffs her other hand.

Outside in space. Spike prepares to do the exchange.

JET: Okay, 6 million turns into 30 million.

SPIKE: The money just keeps growing...

JET: Don't get caught off-gaurd.

SPIKE: Okey dokey.

Spike floats to Gordon's ship. A thug carrying a case of money rises from an elevator.

The Bebop. Ein spots Faye and chases after her.

Outside Gordon's ship.

THUG: Someone who specifies cash up front is rare nowadays.

SPIKE: I'm an old-fashioned guy.

The thug displays the case of money. Spike holds up the chip.

GORDON: All right. We'll both count to three. At which point we will  release the magnetic field of the suitcase and send it that way. You toss the chip our way.

SPIKE: Okay.

JET: I'm trusting you...

On Gordon's ship. Gordon signals one of his henchmen.

GORDON: When you confirm we got the chip, sink that ship.

HENCHMAN: Roger.

Outside Gordon's ship.

THUG: Let's go!

SPIKE: One.

The thug reaches for a gun inside the suitcase.

THUG: Two.

SPIKE: Three.

Spike lets go of the ship. The thug fires at Spike. The shots are blocked by the rotating gravity generator.

On the Bebop. The Red Tail crashes through the shutter and jets off.

JET: Shutters are meant to be OPENED!

Spike floats to the thug from above, dodges his shots, turns off the thug's gravity and kicks him off the ship into deep space.

GORDON: What?!

Spike catches the chip. The Red Tail flies next to Spike.

FAYE: Hi, "Gorgio."

SPIKE: Hey, "Romani." 

The Red Tail takes the case of money and flies away.

FAYE: Bye!

GORDON: Don't let her get away. Fire!!

A chain gun fires at Red Tail.

SPIKE: Shit!

Spike jumps from the ship.

SPIKE: Jet, let's get outta here!

JET: All right!

The Bebop approaches Spike.

GORDON: Get them! Get them! What the hell are you doing?!

Missile are launched from Gordon's ship. Faye pushes a few buttons. The missiles explode.

Gordon's ship.

HENCHMAN A: She dropped the chaff!

HENCHMAN B: What?

HENCHMAN A: Missiles are approaching!

Gordon's ship blows up. Spike returns to the Bebop.

SPIKE: That wench...

Outside a casino on Mars. Spike holds the chip in hand.

SPIKE: It's only proper to use it.

JET: Guess we have to build up again from square one.

Spike and Jet approach the casino. A man yells from a distance.

MAN: That's cheating.

A ship leaves the planet. 

EASY COME, EASY GO...

CLOSING CREDITS

COMING EPISODE

JET: It sucks... this world is such an unruly place. Economic recession everywhere, making kids lose their minds...

SPIKE: Come on, this isn't the time to be reading the paper! Things around the Bebop are becoming even more unruly!

Ein barks.

JET: Bah, this is nothing! Look at this - terrorists! Apparently they want to blow Ganymede up.

SPIKE: Oh? Environmental Protection Society? Perfect! We can have them take care of this fleabag.

JET: Next episode: Gateway Shuffle.

SPIKE: Man, I'M about to lose it.

Next Session: GATEWAY SHUFFLE

Gateway Shuffle

OPENING CREDITS

Red Tail floats in Jupiter space. Faye devours packs of space food in the cockpit. The panel displays "EMPTY." Faye spots a ship on her radar.

FAYE: Someone's here! Hello there! You approaching this area, can you see me? I'm a little troubled because I'm out of gas... Can you take me to Ganymede?

The ship flies away.

FAYE: Oh, dammit, why does everyone...?! Why don't they stop?!

Faye spots a wrecked ship.

Session #4: GATEWAY SHUFFLE

A seafood restaurant in Jupiter space. Spike and Jet sit at a table. Spike flips through a menu.

JET: This sea rat used to be raised in the oceans of Ganymede. After the gates stabilized, food was no longer scarce. And so, now the ones in the wild get eaten by those who have a fancy for them.

SPIKE: So is it good?

JET: It's totally disgusting. It's just expensive because it's a Ganymede specialty.

SPIKE: Then it's no good. I'll have the lobster rice.

Spike orders it with his menu.

MENU: Thank you.

JET: That doesn't look good, either.

SPIKE: Well, I thought I'd go for something expensive while I'm at it.

JET: You mean, because we'll soon have some money?

Jet, wearing a pair of identification glasses spots their bounty, Morgan.

Twinkle Maria Murdock and her boys, the "Space Warriors," eat at another table.

WARRIOR A: To think that Gould was a spy...

WARRIOR B: But, Mom, don't worry. We sunk his ship.

MURDOCK: It's all right. One vial nowadays doesn't mean much... Let's continue the deal as we initially planned. But... who was in charge of watching the house then?

The boys pause. The one named Harrison speaks.

HARRISON: M-Mom...

MURDOCK: It was you, Harrison?

HARRISON: Um, ur, Mom...

MORGAN: Hey! Where's my sea rat saut�?! 

Murdock is angered.

Spike and Jet's table.

JET: Come on, there, come ON!

Morgan's image in through the glasses changes into his face before plastic surgery.

JET: No doubt. It's Morgan.

SPIKE: Then shall we go before we get breakfast?

Murdock approaches Morgan's table.

MURDOCK: Hey, kid, did you know that the Ganymede sea rat is a very intelligent and kind animal?

SPIKE: What's that?

JET: That woman... I think she was...

MORGAN: I don't remember ordering a circus!

The Space Warriors open fire on the people of the restaurant.

Spike and Jet hide under a table.

JET: I know I've seen her somewhere...

A Space Warrior throws a grenade. The grenade shines the Space Warriors' logo.

VOICE: We, the Space Warriors, work night and day to preserve the environment and protect endangered species all over the universe.

JET: I remember now! That lady's worth 25 million!

Murdock and her boys prepare to leave.

WARRIOR: Mom, Hurry!

Spike points a gun at Twinkle's head.

SPIKE: This is the end, Mademoiselle.

WARRIORS: Mom?!

SPIKE: Don't move! Do you want to see your mom in pain?

WARRIOR: Who are you?

SPIKE: How's Morgan?

Jet examines Morgan.

JET: He's full of holes.

SPIKE: That's a problem... He was gonna put food on our table. But he's worth nothing compared to the 25 million that you're worth...

The Space Warriors point their guns at Spike.

WARRIOR A: YOU!

WARRIOR B: Let go of Mom!

MURDOCK: Stop it. These guys are bounty hunters. We can't do anything.

WARRIOR: Mom...!

MURDOCK: Take care of the home... I'll be back soon...

SPIKE: Come on... If you don't go now, the cops are gonna arrive!

WARRIOR: Mom, sit tight!

MURDOCK: Harrison, you'll get plenty of punishment later.

HARRISON: M-Mom?!

Harrison reaches out for Murdock.

WARRIOR: Let's go!

HARRISON: Mom!!

The Space Warriors exit.

SPIKE: Lucky you, Harrison. Your mom won't be back for a while.

Jupiter Space. Faye finds an injured man in the wrecked ship.

FAYE: Hey, are you alive?!

MAN: Please... Take this to the ISSP... But don't open it...

The man dies.

FAYE: H-Hey, wait a minute!! What does he want me to do?!

The Bebop. Jet flips through image files depicting the Space Warriors' history. Murdock is tied to a chair.

SPIKE: Universal Environmental Protection Society?

JET: More like environmental terrorists. They're called the Space Warriors. They used to be a good group working on environmental preservations and the protection of endangered species. But since their leader changed two years ago, their focus drastically changed. They are only a few members but now they're even worse than a lot of syndicates out there. They're especially keen on protecting the Ganymede sea rats. And she's the leader of this terrorist group: Twinkle Maria Murdock.

MURDOCK: Please, don't associate us with terrorists! We are warriors of peace, fighting for the law of nature.

SPIKE: Yeah, yeah. And where can we get t he 25 million reward?

JET: The Ganymede government. But we can't cash in.

SPIKE: Huh?

JET: I'm checking on it... The government canceled the reward yesterday.

SPIKE: Why?

Jupiter Space. The Red Tail.

Faye shakes a suit case.

FAYE: When you're told not to open it, the more you want to.

Faye opens the case.

FAYE: I didn't open it! This thing opened by itself!

Debris in space. The Space Warriors' ship. Wild ape men trapped in capsules. Two men load a biological warhead. Several men talk to the Ganymede police chief.

CHIEF: So, as you requested, we have canceled the bounty and we are debating about prohibiting the fishing of sea rats on Ganymede as well.

WARRIOR: So where's Mom?

CHIEF: As I said, we haven't gotten word of Twinkle's capture! If we can find out who captured her...

WARRIOR: If Mom doesn't come back we'll set that plan into action immediately.

CHIEF: W-Wait! We're not going against your wishes...

The Space Warriors hang up.

The Red Tail. Faye examines a strange capsule from the case.

FAYE: Doesn't look like it would ease my hunger.

Faye spots a ship.

The Bebop.

JET: Wait a minute, that terrorist ace we saw isn't on the records either!

SPIKE: What's going on?

MURDOCK: See? I told you that you couldn't do anything. So you can just let me go.

JET: I don't get it... There's something behind all this.

Jet receives a signal.

FAYE: Hello there! You approaching this area, can you see me? I'm a little troubled because I'm out of gas...

SPIKE: Hey, she's...

FAYE: Can you take me to Ganymede?

No reply.

FAYE: Please? Even getting a little propellant would be wonderful!

No reply.

FAYE: Hey! Can you hear me or WHAT?!

Faye looks out, and sees the Bebop.

FAYE: D'oh...

EYECATCH

Spike examines a pile of junk. Faye is cuffed to a handrail in the living room.

SPIKE: Then, what? You spent all the money you took from us at the casino?!

FAYE: As they say, "Money makes the world go round."

SPIKE: They also say, "thieves have no compassion." How is it over there?

JET: Yeah, I'm contacting an old friend.

SPIKE: Man, there isn't even anything worth keeping... Huh? What's this?

Spike finds the capsule. Twinkle is shocked.

Ganymede. The chief in his office on the phone.

CHIEF: Yes... I still don't know where that virus is... Yes, Mr. President... We will continue to do our best!

He hangs up and immediately receives another call.

OFFICER: Chief!

CHIEF: What?

OFFICER: The one who nabbed Twinkle...

CHIEF: You found them?!

Spike struggles to open the capsule.

SPIKE: And, that guy told you to take this to the ISSP?

FAYE: Yup. Doesn't that look like it's worth something? So how about we call it even?

SPIKE: I never trust anything thieves say.

Jet speaks to an officer named Bob via videophone.

JET: WHAT?! What's all this about?! Hey, Bob!

BOB: Nothing is really up. The bounty has been canceled. They're saying you should let her go immediately.

JET: Hey, Bob. When we worked in the same department a lot of the confiscated eyedrops disappeared, you know.

BOB: W-What do ya wanna say?

JET: If you wanna work until retirement age isn't it a better idea for you to go along with me?

BOB: Oh, all right. I get what you're saying.

Spike steps on the capsule.

FAYE: Hey, don't break it!

BOB: The guys are threatening under the mask of "negotiation." They're holding the 8 million residents of Ganymede hostage.

JET: What do you mean by that?

BOB: They basically kidnapped the leader in virus technology and created a virus to their liking. The virus is called Monkey Business. They say that humans and monkeys only have a 2% difference in DNA structure and apparently this virus acts on those two percent. So that virus selectively acts only on humans.

Spike examines the capsule.

FAYE: Why don't you give up?

BOB: We lost contact with the ISSP spy that infiltrated their group so we had no other option...

JET: So you're going to agree to their terms?!

Spike sets the capsule down and draws his gun.

JET: Man, this was a big one that we caught, too!

BOB: It's orders from up above! WE couldn't do anything about it!

Spike fires and destroys the base holding the capsule, sending the capsule flying. Jet catches the capsule.

JET: We're releasing her.

Murdock laughs maniacally.

The Space Warriors' ship attaches onto the Bebop.

MURDOCK: Us... or them...? Which one of us deserves punishment from Heaven? Soon, the time of judgment will arrive... Yes... soon...

Murdock exits.

Ganymede control station.

OFFICER: The release procedure has been completed. We will continue to monitor her using our special agents.

CHIEF: How's the satellite?

OFFICER: It will be ready in about an hour.

CHIEF: Get the chemical tech group as well. Don't do anything until we know where the virus is.

OFFICER: Sir, a communication from Twinkle.

Murdock appears on the central monitor.

MURDOCK: Long time no see, Minister. About that promise we made...

CHIEF: So... about the sea rats, we will keep a stable population using limitations on hunting them...

MURDOCK: Didn't I say PROHIBITION of hunting?

CHIEF: W-Well, we will look at the demands in a positive light...

MURDOCK: Looks like you need some punishment to understand.

Murdock disconnects.

CHIEF: AH! Hey! WAIT!

In the Space Warriors' ship. Harrison is locked in a capsule.

HARRISON: Mom! I don't want to become a monkey! MOM!!

The Bebop. Cuffed Faye growls at Ein.

Space debris. Police ships spot the Space Warriors' ship.

OFFICER A: Alpha 1-0-5 to headquarters. The target has entered the wasteland area.

OFFICER B: Roger. Continue pursuit.

Bombs explode.

OFFICER B: Man, they're too easygoing.

The police ships leave the area. Out of the debris, the Space Warriors' ship takes off.

The Bebop in line at the entrance of a hyperspace gate.

JET: Dammit... All that and no reward...

Bob calls.

BOB: Jet, can you hear me? Turn on channel 72 and watch it! They're broadcasting from their own satellite!

Jet tunes in.

MURDOCK: This isn't just about the sea rats. Humans, with their culture have escaped from The great system of nature and are committing crimes that cannot be amended. Those that don't realize this are what you could call "bugs" in the nature system.

In space, Murdock's ship explodes, blowing away surrounding police ships.

BOB: That ship was a decoy!

JET: Where are they broadcasting from?

SPIKE: It's near here. They're in hyperspace!

Murdock's real ship floats in hyperspace.

MURDOCK: Monkey Business, our virus takes such humans and returns them to nature. Understand? Au revoir.

Murdock launches a large missile, heading strait for the Ganymede.

BOB: Good news, Jet! The Ganymede government has reestablished the ransom on Twinkle and company!

JET: What?!

SPIKE: This is our chance! WE'RE the only ones around here!

BOB: But just catching them won't do. If the missile falls, there'll be nobody here that can pay the bounty!

Faye refuels Red Tail. Ein is cuffed to a rail.

Outside the Bebop.

SPIKE: So there's nothing to bitch about if we get rid of the missile, right?

JET: But they're at the exit to a gate.

Spike enters the gate

Control center.

OFFICER A: What about the defense system!?

OFFICER B: 4 minutes and 30 seconds to impact!

OFFICER C: The system won't make it in time!

CHIEF: T-This is an emergency! Get the President!

Hyperspace.

SPIKE: They're here.

The missile splits in three.

SPIKE: It split?! SHIT!

Spike fires the plasma cannon and hits two. Spike makes a u-turn.

SPIKE: Jet! Get the last one!

JET: What?! There aren't any weapons over here!

SPIKE: If I wait for the next shot to fully charge, that thing'll hit Ganymede!

Faye appears on the monitor.

FAYE: Oh? Are you in trouble? How about for 80% of the earnings?

SPIKE: You've got to be kidding!

FAYE: Okay, bye! Have a nice day!

SPIKE: All right. 40%. No more.

FAYE: OK! I get the 60!

JET: Fine... We got no choice.

Jet opens the hanger door and Red Tail takes off into the gate.

In hyperspace.

SPIKE: Shit, will she make it in time?

FAYE: Welcome!

Faye fires a missile. The missile explodes into countless warheads.

FAYE: What is this?!

SPIKE: Multiple warheads?! This ain't the military!!

Murdock's ship.

MURDOCK: Now all of you, become apes!

The Bebop.

BOB: Jet! The guys from the government are closing down the gate!

JET: What?!

BOB: They're going to enclose all of it in hyperspace, missile and all!

FAYE: Wait a minute, this isn't a joke!

JET: Spike!

Faye makes a u-turn.

SPIKE: I hear ya...!

JET: Spike!

Swordfish and Red Tail fly out of the closing gate.

Faye sighs a breath of relief. The astro-image of the missiles fly pass Red Tail.

FAYE: Why...?

Faye panics and ducks.

JET: Didn't you learn in high school? Matter that gets enclosed in hyperspace can be seen but will never interact with matter in this realm again.

In enclosed hyperspace. The Space Warrior's ship floats by the closed gate exit.

WARRIOR A: Mom! The gate's closed!

WARRIOR B: Hey, Mom, what can we do?!

Murdock twitches. A booster malfunctions.

WARRIOR C: Stop! Stop!

The ship experiences a sudden jolt. The capsule containing the virus slips out of Murdock's coat.

Murdock recalls an earlier scene. Spike had slipped the capsule in her coat as Murdock was leaving the Bebop.

The capsule smashes.

The Bebop living room.

FAYE: So... this and that and no reward. All that work for nothing. Oh, don't look so down, we can make money next time. Well, I'll go take a shower.

Faye walks away.

SPIKE: Next time? Make money? Hey, Jet, what did she just say?

JET: Don't ask me! Just don't!

SPIKE: And she's off to shower without asking us... Hey are we gonna take all of this?

JET: Don't tell me! Just don't!

SPIKE: Fine, I'll go tell her.

Spike walks away.

JET: Hey, Spike...

Gunshots.

JET: Should've seen that coming.

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

COMING EPISODE

SPIKE: The supposedly broken music box starts to move and a nostalgic tune fills the air. I then happen to wake up from the dream. There is no such thing as a music box yet, there is a small music box nestled in my hand. And I awake from the dream again. As if I was peeling an onion, it's a dream no matter how far I go. I can never return to reality. Such a nightmare, this is. Next episode: Ballad Of Fallen Angels.

Next Session: BALLAD OF FALLEN ANGELS

Ballad of Fallen Angels

OPENING CREDITS

Hyperspace rings over Mars. A skyscraper on Mars. A syndicate leader, Mao Yenrai, signs a deal with a leader of another syndicate, Carlos.

CARLOS: Confirmed.

MAO: To our new relationship, and our new friendship.

CARLOS: And to prosperity. The view from here makes me sad that I must leave so soon. It's an amazing sight.

MAO: Next time, we should have dinner together. The Cantonese cuisine that our head chef makes is just about as superb as this scenery.

CARLOS: That's a wonderful invitation, however to think that I'd dine with an executive from the Red Dragon.

MAO: Rest assured, the food will not be poisoned.

Carlos' ship leaves the building.

MAO: I can finally take a breather. Thank God.

Carlos' ship explodes.

A thug holds a sword to Mao's neck. Mao's guards are killed. A black bird squawks. A man named Vicious enters with a black bird on his shoulder.

MAO: Doing things like this won't do you any good! Times have changed! The syndicate cannot survive just by fighting alone!

Mao's throat is slashed.

MAO: Only if... Spike returned... someone like you would...

Vicious smiles. A his black bird squeaks.

Session #5: BALLAD OF FALLEN ANGELS

The Bebop. The monitor displays Mao. Spike shuffles a deck of cards.

JET: I don't feel up for this.

Spike stops shuffling.

SPIKE: Wha-?

JET: I said I don't feel like doing this.

SPIKE: Then there's no choice.

Spike puts down the deck.

JET: Wait, Spike.

SPIKE: I can't burden you.

JET: Don't say stuff like that. You know who that is, don't you?

SPIKE: Superficial stuff, yeah.

JET: Then...

SPIKE: Good money. Easy to get info on him. We also have a lead. What makes you scared?

JET: Spike, you're deliberately avoiding the subject. Are you hiding something from me?

SPIKE: So... what happened to that arm of yours?

JET: What does that have to do with anything?

SPIKE: Nothing.

JET: So you have no intention of telling me?

SPIKE: I could ask you the same.

Silence.

Faye enters carrying shopping bags.

FAYE: Why is this door so damn narrow? Oh? Am I interrupting something?

JET: None of your business.

FAYE: We're supposed to be comrades! That's awfully cold of you!

JET: What do you mean, comrades? Troublemakers should keep themselves outta this.

FAYE: Well, I don't care.

Faye leans over the monitor.

FAYE: So, who is this? What's he up to?

JET: Don't look without asking us.

FAYE: What do you mean? He's just there on the screen!

Spike gets up.

JET: Spike! Hey, wait, Spike!

Spike exits and boards Swordfish II.

SPIKE: I'm taking off.

JET: Spike! Shit, I won't be responsible for you!

SPIKE: Roger that.

Swordfish II takes off.

JET: Dammit! He's such a...

FAYE: Mao Yenrai. A bounty of 28 million for the alleged murder of an executive from an opposing syndicate. Amazing! And you guys are after him?

Jet turns off the monitor.

FAYE: What, did you have a fight?

JET: Shut up. You're being obnoxious.

FAYE: You're such a kid.

JET: I said, your being obnoxious!

Jet slams his communicator sending the top card of the deck to the floor.

JET: He can do whatever the hell he pleases.

Jet exits.

FAYE: Oh, God... He's throwing such a huge fit.

Faye picks up the dropped card. The video phone rings.

MAN: You there, Jet? I got something big for ya!

FAYE: Something big?

Faye sees that the card is the ace of spades.

A concert hall on Mars. Red Tail lands in front of it.

Faye enters.

DOORMAN: Excuse me, madam, but I need to see your ticket.

FAYE: Oh, I don't have anything like that.

DOORMAN: Then I am afraid that you cannot enter the hall...

FAYE: But they told me I didn't need one. You know. The guy in the box seat... HIM.

DOORMAN: Mao Yenr-

Faye silences him.

FAYE: Can you park my vehicle for me?

Faye drops him her key for the Red Tail.

The Bebop. Jet looks for information on Mao in a secret internet database.

JET: If it's not one, it's the other. Why do they all do everything as they please?! There's a protective encryption on this thing.

Ein looks up.

JET: You worried? Just watch. These are decrypted like this...

Jet bypasses the encryption.

JET: See? And then, I input "Mao Yenrai."

Jet reads Mao's entry.

JET: The bounty part sure seems to be true, but...

The concert hall. Faye approaches the box. A thug stands guard.

FAYE: Is this Mao-taijin's (Sir Mao's) seat? I've looked all over for it. Actually, I...

THUG A: We were waiting for you.

Another thug points a gun at her back.

FAYE: U-Um...

THUG B: They are performing, so please stay quiet.

A convenience store on Mars. Two kids look at adult magazines. Just as they stuff the magazines in their shirts the store owner, Annie, catches them in the act.

ANNIE: Hold it right there!

The kids run outside. One of the kids trip. Annie, grabs him.

ANNIE: I'm not letting you get away!

The other kid bumps into Spike.

KID: Watcha doin'?!

The kid notices that the magazine is missing from his shirt. Spike begins reading the magazine.

KID: Give it back! Shit. Give it back, you dumb-ass!

Annie grabs the kid.

ANNIE: Really, kids these days...! I'll hand you over to the cops.

Annie notices Spike.

ANNIE: Y-You!

SPIKE: Yo.

The kids slip away.

The store. Annie gulps down a full shot of liquor.

SPIKE: Hey, isn't it bad for you to drink it in one shot, Annie?

ANNIE: You coming back to life is worse on me than this glass.

SPIKE: What terrible treatment!

Annie refills her glass.

ANNIE: The words of the dead are meaningless.

SPIKE: But I'm alive.

ANNIE: No, you died three years ago! That's how things work here. I know. The fact that you came here... means you have something you want to know, right? If it's not much, I can be of help.

SPIKE: Anastasia...

ANNIE: Stop it! There are only two people that can call me by that name... So, what do you want to know?

SPIKE: Mao Yenrai. What happened to him?

Annie's hand begins to shake.

The concert hall.

FAYE: Mao-taijin? There's a reason for this...

THUG: No need to talk, Miss Valentine.

The thug holds her key for the Red Tail.

THUG: We have done a background check already. Rest assured, it will be held in a safe location. Please, to your seat.

Faye sits down. She looks over to Mao. His neck is slashed.

VICIOUS: You're trembling...

FAYE: Who... are you?

VICIOUS: Vicious.

EYECATCH

A "CLOSED" sign hangs at the front window of Annie's store. Annie puts down a gun. Spike takes it. Annie pulls out and puts down a cigarette carton.

ANNIE: You know... I won't say anything bad to ya. Don't get yourself involved with Vicious anymore... But I know saying that is useless.

SPIKE: Sorry.

Spike opens the cigarette carton. Inside are rows of bullets.

ANNIE: You've never listened to what others say.

She takes another drink.

ANNIE: On top of it, you're a stubborn show-off! It can't hurt you to listen to your elders once in a while... About Mao... He had a lot of people looking for you after you were gone. He said that you still had to be alive... You're finally back, but Mao is...

Annie pours herself another glass.

SPIKE: Stop it already.

ANNIE: This is for Mao!

Spike takes the glass and drinks it.

SPIKE: I'll take that one for Mao.

The Bebop. Spike opens the refrigerator, takes a gun and a bag of grenades.

The living room. Spike organizes. He aims his unloaded gun at Jet.

JET: What are you up to now... to need something like THAT?

SPIKE: Where's the broad?

JET: She lost sanity looking at the bounty figure and took off. Right now she's probably somewhere, screwing up.

SPIKE: I see.

Spike loads a clip.

JET: I'll tell you something. You won't get the bounty for Mao. He's already dead. He was killed. Internal discord. Do you understand? This is a trap! I'm sure of it!

SPIKE: Yeah. I know all that.

JET: You know?! Then what, you're Mao's...?

SPIKE: I owe him one from before...

JET: I'll tell you something, Spike. This arm. It's the price I paid for being overspirited and running ahead of the game. You understand?

SPIKE: I don't wanna go, either.

JET: Then...

SPIKE: Let's just say, duties of the life I live.

Faye calls the videophone. She is captured.

FAYE: Tee hee. I've been caught.

JET: You...

FAYE: Come to the place we specify. Otherwise, my life is over. So they say. Lesse... the time to meet is...

JET: It's because you did as you please.

FAYE: You're being cold. We're comrades, remember?

JET: You reap what you sow. Take care of it all yourself.

Jet reaches over to hang up.

FAYE: Hey wait!

Spike stops him.

SPIKE: Where is it?

FAYE: You're really gonna come?

SPIKE: Don't worry. I'm not going there to save you.

JET: Spike!

An abandoned church. Spike enters. Vicious meets him in the aisle.

VICIOUS: Angels that are forced from heaven have to become demons. Isn't that right, Spike?

SPIKE: I'm only watching a dream that I never awakened from.

VICIOUS: I'll wake you up right now.

SPIKE: Don't be so anxious, Vicious. It's our first time meeting in a while, right?

VICIOUS: A plea for your life?

SPIKE: Hardly. Something that doesn't work on you, remember? After all, you even kill those who've saved your life.

VICIOUS: He was a beast who lost his fangs. That's why he's dead. The same goes for you.

A thug holds Faye at gunpoint. Spike points his gun at him.

THUG: Now, we want you to drop your gun.

No reply.

THUG: What's wrong? If you don't hurry...

Spike shoots him in the head.

Guns blaze. Spike guns down two men. A stray bullet flies inches from Faye.

FAYE: Are ya tryin' to kill me?

A thug falls from a balcony right before Faye.

Faye exits.

Spike runs up a flight of stairs, he shoots a thug at the top of the stairs. The thug shoots him in the gut.

The Bebop. Jet accidentally clips a large limb from one of his bonsai trees.

JET: Oh, man, what the hell've I done...?

Jet's communicator rings.

JET: Yeah?

FAYE: Thank God! Jet? Spike is...

JET: Not my problem!

Jet hangs up. Jet stares at the fallen limb.

JET: Goddamn it!

Jet exits.

Spike guns down a machine gun wielding thug. Ambushed, Spike duels Vicious. Vicious directs his sword at Spike's heart. Spike points his gun at Vicious' heart.

VICIOUS: Spike. Do you know what your face looks like right now?

SPIKE: What?

VICIOUS: The same blood runs in you and me. The blood of a beast who wanders, desiring the blood of others.

SPIKE: I've bled all of that blood away.

VICIOUS: Then why are you still alive?!

Vicious stabs Spike in the shoulder while Spike shoots Vicious in the shoulder. Vicious throws Spike out a stained glass window. Spike drops a grenade.

Memories of a blonde woman, a rainy street, gunfire, roses, a time of friendship, a bar scene, a gun pointed at the woman's head, Vicious in bed with the woman, a bloody smile, a red rose in a puddle.

An explosion from the stained glass window.

Wandering down a street, a bloody Spike falls in front of the blonde woman.

The blonde woman hums. Spike regains consciousness. The woman stops humming. Spike is bandaged all over on her bed in her apartment.

SPIKE: Just like that... sing for me.

The woman smiles.

Faye hums. The Bebop. Spike is bandaged all over on the living room couch. Faye plays solitaire. Faye notices Spike is awake.

FAYE: Oh, you're finally up. You've slept too much. It's been three days. What, I was worried about you. You have to be thankful to me!

Spike signals Faye to approach him. Faye puts her ear to his bandaged mouth.

SPIKE: Tone-deaf.

Faye is angered. Faye slams the deck of cards onto Spike's chest, bursting a pillow. Cards fly.

JET: Oh, well...

Spike examines the card on his forehead. The ace of spades.

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

SPIKE: But you know what? What a tough world we live in nowadays...

JET: What are you talking about?

SPIKE: This guy, that guy... They're all trying to put a lid on something that stinks.

JET: Yeah.

SPIKE: Can we let things go on like that?

JET: I'm asking you, what ARE you talking about?

SPIKE: World affairs man! World affairs! With all these lids about, the world'll be buried in lids!

JET: I don't really get it...

SPIKE: With stuff like that, you can't see the truth!

JET: Truth, huh...?

SPIKE: So lids like that... I'll crush them all away! Next Episode: Sympathy for the Devil.

JET: That sounds... smelly.

SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

Sympathy for the Devil

OPENING CREDITS

Distorted images. Bubbles, a fish with large fins, various organs, a black sphere. A group of doctors operate on Spike.

A blues house. Spike wakes up from a dream and sees a talented harmonica playing boy.

Session #6: SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

The Bebop. Faye walks to the refrigerator. Empty except for a can of dog food. Ein pants. Faye spots Ein, and smiles. She opens the can and begins eating its contents. Ein stops panting.

FAYE: Those who don't work, don't eat. Go find your own food. Me? I'm okay. Women are grand by birth.

Faye gobbles up the rest of the dog food. Ein sits and watches. Faye sits down and picks up a poster for their next target.

FAYE: 3 Million... Well, I'll have the guys earn it for me.

The blues house.

JET: Damn, blues harp music is good. It's just as good as I thought.

SPIKE: I thought you were a fan of jazz music?

JET: Don't be stupid. I even warbled when I was sucking on my mother's milk!

SPIKE: You were a pretty thoughtful kid...

Spike identifies their next target.

SPIKE: No mistake, that's Giraffe.

JET: All right, I'm going from the right. You go from the left.

Spike spots a heavyset man.

SPIKE: There's a fatso in the way...

JET: That's... Fatty.

SPIKE: The ball's in your court.

JET: Hey, Fatty! Fatty River! Long time no see!

FATTY: Oh! Who'd have thought, it's Jet Black! When the hell did you get here?

JET: How about you? You look so easygoing! Did ya catch a big one?

Giraffe follows a man in a wheel chair and the harmonica player. Spike follows them.

JET: I didn't know you were a fan of blues music.

FATTY: You're kidding me. I've lived only for the blues since I was in my dad's sac!

The crippled man and the boy board a taxi cab. Giraffe calls for a taxi and continues chasing them. Spike heads for Swordfish II in a parking lot.

A hotel. Giraffe kicks in a door and finds the crippled man and the boy.

GIRAFFE: Give him back! Zebra!

Giraffe crashes out a window. Spike catches him with Swordfish and lands.

SPIKE: Hey you! Don't die! Hey! Shit, are you going to wipe out my bounty?

GIRAFFE: D-Don't be fooled by his appearance...

SPIKE: You idiot! Don't speak!

GIRAFFE: Him... Help...him... This stone...

Giraffe hands spike a glowing pink stone.

SPIKE: Hey!

The police arrive.

The Bebop. Jet examines the stone.

JET: I can't say for sure until I analyze it but it might be worth a hefty sum. So, what are ya gonna do?

Jet tosses the stone to Spike.

SPIKE: Like I know? He's the one who gave it to me, and he's the one who went off and died. I see no harm in keeping it.

Faye snatches the stone.

FAYE: There is no harm. After all, it's not your duty to help the kid.

Spike snatches it back.

SPIKE: This is gonna pay for our food. There's none for you.

FAYE: You have such a poor heart.

JET: I'm not like that. Here, have a gift.

Jet gives Faye a slip of paper.

FAYE: Oh, what's this? An invoice? What for?

JET: All the expenses that you've racked up on our ship. Thanks for your business!

FAYE: You're welcome.

An outdoors cafe. Jet and Fatty sit at a table full of pastries.

FATTY: So why are you asking about the dead bounty?

JET: Well... uh...

FATTY: So you were after Giraffe, too.

Fatty takes the cream off the top of a cake and eats it.

FATTY: Ya got a good deal?

JET: Go ahead, eat.

FATTY: Ah well. There's no bounty in it anyway.

JET: Yeah. No gain at all.

Fatty gives Jet a suspicious look.

JET: No, no. There really is nothing.

FATTY: Ah well. You'll owe me one for today. You know that kid on the bluesharp the other day? Giraffe was after that kid Wen's father. His old acquaintance, Zebra.

JET: Acquaintance?

FATTY: You didn't even know that? That they were the top of the Volunteer Self Defense Squad until ten years ago?

JET: But why is he after an old comrade?

FATTY: Three years ago, Zebra and Giraffe accepted to reclaim a certain facility. But, a few days later, Zebra ends up missing and Giraffe finds himself blindfolded in a weird place he'd never seen before. Giraffe was going after the top spot in the group, but he was betrayed. But Zebra was still alive.

Back on the Bebop.

FAYE: So, in the end, Giraffe was killed by some form of betrayal?

JET: Women easily betray others, but men live for duty.

FAYE: Duty, huh...?

JET: That's what I'd like to believe.

Spike follows Wen and Zebra into a shady warehouse. The lights suddenly blaze on. Spike points his gun at them.

WEN: Who are you?

SPIKE: Someone suspicious.

WEN: What do you want?

SPIKE: Giraffe asked me to help you.

The Bebop.

FAYE: But Zebra shot Giraffe.

JET: Yeah.

FAYE: Then why did Giraffe tell him to help the kid?

Jet and Faye look at an old newspaper article on Wen. 

FAYE: This kid's showing up here, too. He must be pretty famous.

JET: Yeah. The kid's a genius.

Faye notices the man behind Wen in the photograph.

FAYE: This guy isn't Zebra!

JET: What?!

FAYE: Look... the date!

JET: What the-?! Why the hell is this kid in an article from 30 years ago with the same face?!

Back at the warehouse.

SPIKE: Come on. There's nothing to fear. Come over here.

Wen shoots Spike's near the elbow. He drops his gun.

WEN: Little twerps should stay outta this. If you stick your neck in too far, you'll get burnt.

SPIKE: Don't give me that conceited crap, kid.

WEN: I ain't a kid

SPIKE: All kids say that.

WEN: I may look like this, but I've been alive since the days when humans crawled only on the face of the Earth.

EYECATCH

Fifty year ago. A hyperspace gate outside of Earth explodes. Wen emerges from a pile of chared bodies.

Present day. The warehouse.

WEN: It started on the day of the accidental explosion of the hyperspace gate. My body has ceased to age. I can't die. The guys that took interest in me, and experimented on me, all died before me. The end for this guy started when he snuck into the lab. I needed a "parent" to use as a cover.

Spike recalls Giraffe's final words.

GIRAFFE: D-Don't be fooled by his appearance... him... Help... him...

WEN: I think this was the third guy. Now, gimme the ring.

SPIKE: Ring? What ring?

Wen shoots at Spike.

WEN: That's fine... Even if you had it, it's a pearl before swine.

Wen continues to fire at Spike. Spike dodges and retrieves his gun and shoots back at him. Wen flees and pushes Zebra down a flight of stairs. Spike catches Zebra and shoots Wen in the head. Wen falls. Spike sets Zebra down and goes to the spot Wen fell. He only finds a large puddle of blood.

The Bebop. Jet bandages Spike's wound. Ein rest near Zebra who lies catatonic.

JET: Give me a break, you big klutz! You're lucky you got away with this little since we don't have the money for a funeral!

SPIKE: Sorry.

Ein barks loudly near Zebra.

JET: Knock it off, Ein! Shut up.

Faye walks near Ein and notices tears from Zebra's eyes.

FAYE: Oh?

Jet and Spike begin to notice.

SPIKE: Jet, the "alpha-catch."

Zebra is hooked up to a machine that reads mental images and displays them on a monitor. There is only noise on the monitor.

JET: Shit... this piece of junk.

A picture of Giraffe rushing into the hotel room forms.

JET: All right! Now, what are ya seein'?

SPIKE: The hotel. He's remembering the time that Giraffe died.

GIRAFFE: Give him back! Zebra! Come over here!

The picture disintegrates into noise again.

JET: Shit! And then what? What did Giraffe say!?

The picture returns.

GIRAFFE: I have it now. I can do you in with this. This is a stone that will return time to you! Now, hand Zebra over to me! Zebra!

Giraffe is shot out of the window.

The stone is carved into a bullet. Spike loads a gun with it, puts the gun in a holster and slings it over his shoulder.

JET: When the gate exploded, a vast amount of energy and an imaginary coordinate system were created from the resulting twists in hyperspace and got enclosed into the gem of this ring. And that same energy broke Wen's circadian rhythm. His pineal gland continually produces a substance similar to melatonin that inhibits aging. That's how the theory goes in a nutshell. You understand?

SPIKE: Like I do...

JET: I don't either. So, in other words, there's no way to make sure other than to stick that gem into Wen. I don't know what will happen. It might explode the moment you shoot it in.

SPIKE: This makes me excited.

Spike begins to walk out. Faye stops him midway.

SPIKE: What?

FAYE: I thought this might be the last time I'd see you, so I thought I'd see you off.

SPIKE: Oh, so you're finally going to leave us?

FAYE: No, you aren't coming back.

Jet puts a cigarette in Spike's mouth and lights it.

SPIKE: I don't like it. I don't like it one bit.

Spike takes off in Swordfish.

FAYE: Men are such idiots...

The city. Wen kills a taxi driver and steal his cab. Spike shoots at it in Swordfish. The cab crashes into a gas pump off road and explodes. Wen emerges from the flames and shoots at Spike. Spike aims his gun at Wen and shoots the gem directly into his forehead. Wen begins to age immediately and collapses.

WEN: I see... I can finally die now... But... I feel so at ease now... Do you know...? Do you understand...? Do you...?

Wen dies. Spike takes Wen's harmonica and blows into it.

SPIKE: Like I do...

Spike tosses the harmonica into the air and points his finger at it.

SPIKE: Bang.

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

A space truck flies into a rotating truck stop. Heavy metal blasts from the truck.


Session #7
HEAVY METAL QUEEN

The truck stop. A fat black cat named Zeros and a trucker named VT, check in. VT's friend, Otto, calls her from above.

OTTO: VT! Your shift's up?

Otto floats down.

VT: Finally. How about you?

OTTO: I'm off to Europa now.

VT: That's got pretty good pay.

OTTO: It's nothing compared to yours. I heard you made a round-trip from here to Venus in 4 days?

VT: Three days.

OTTO: See what I mean? Anyway, take it easy.

VT: Thanks.

Otto floats away.

OTTO: Oh, yeah, I forgot. VT!

Otto floats down and puts down two 1000-Woolong bills.

VT: You're still not giving up?

OTTO: Of course not! How much do ya think I lent ya?

VT: Suit yourself...

VT puts down a large stack of bills.

VT: All right. You only get one shot, and you get no clues.

OTTO: Yeah! VT, your name is... Vivian Tillana.

VT smiles.

VT: Nope!

OTTO: Oh, man... This is a bad omen...

VT: You be careful now. 

The sidewalk outside Mac's Diner. VT walks by an old bounty hunter and three upstart punks sitting to the side.

OLD BOUNTY HUNTER: Yeah, you know that cock-eye guy that was worth 8 million the other day? Believe it or not, I was the one who caught him!

PUNK A: What do you mean "the other day?" That was 10 years ago you old geezer!

OLD BOUNTY HUNTER: What are you saying, you young'uns! I was the one that taught Terpsichore!

PUNK B: You mean the legendary bounty hunter?

OLD BOUNTY HUNTER: Every bounty cowered in fear just at the mention of his name...

PUNK A: Oh, everyone knows THAT.

VT, Zeros on her shoulder, enters Mac's Diner. The diner is full of bounty hunters. VT sits on a stool at the counter. Zeros meows at the owner, a man named Macho.

MACHO: Hey, Zeros. Welcome, VT. The usual?

VT: Yeah. What's going on today? The place is usually empty.

MACHO: Oh, this? Apparently a bounty named Decker is gonna pass by around here. They're all bounty hunters.

VT: No wonder they all look so cheap.

The men's room. Spike sits on the can talking to Faye through a radio transmitter.

SPIKE: What was that about "top secret" information? This place is full of our kind. And I got a hangover today, too... Besides, we don't know the face. The only clue is a dragon-shaped tattoo... Faye? Like that place is gonna be any better.

A children's ice cream parlor called "Woody's" featuring cartoons characters "Mackey" and "Mannie" as waiters and waitresses.

INTERCOM: Welcome to Woody's! Right now, all of our friends who are celebrating their birthdays can get their pictures taken with Mackey and Mannie! Moms and dads, please tell your server!

Faye spots a brawny man walk in with a tattoo on his half-revealed chest. She approaches him.

FAYE: Hi.

TATTOO MAN: Whadduyawant? Ya wanna get some?

FAYE: I'd rather be the one that gives some.

TATTOO MAN: I'm fine with that.

Faye points a gun at the tattoo man.

FAYE: Hands in the air, Decker!

Decker, a scrawny man sitting directly behind Faye and the tattoo man, spits his drink.

Back at Mac's. A waitress named Murial is harassed by the "Memphis Brothers," three perverted bounty hunter.

MURIAL: Don't be so difficult!

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: Just get the hell over here.

MURIAL: But I have work!

MEMPHIS BROTHER B: Just make yourself comfortable!

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: Git!

The pervert grabs Murial.

MURIAL: P-Please, stop.

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: I'll give you a good time.

MURIAL: Stop! Someone...!

VT punches one of them out.

MEMPHIS BROTHER C: What the hell are ya...?

MURIAL: VT!

VT: So it's a bounty hunter's job to chase a woman's ass instead of a bounty?

Woody's.

FAYE: Sorry, but this is my job.

TATTOO MAN: W-What...?

FAYE: Don't play dumb with me. That dragon-shaped tattoo is unmistakable proof.

Decker covers the dragon tattoo on his forearm and tries to get away.

TATTOO MAN: Y-You got the wrong man...

Faye notices the Decker but doesn't know who he is.

FAYE: Hey, you over there! Call the police! Tell them I caught Decker the bounty!

Decker nods and scrambles out the door. Faye sees Decker's tattoo. She rips open the tattoo man's shirt and sees a gaudy eel tattoo.

FAYE: This is...?

TATOO MAN: "Yakkun," the eight-eyed eel...

FAYE: Don't be so mistakable!

Mac's Diner. A fight breaks out. Spike tries to make a "prairie oyster," separating egg yoke from white. VT punches one of the Memphis Brothers and he bumps into Spike.

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: Why, you!

Spike notices the yoke dropped onto his crotch.

Faye chases after Decker in Red Tail.

Mac's Diner. The Memphis Brothers take out switchblades.

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: You...!

MURIAL: VT!

MEMPHIS BROTHER C: You're wearing my patience thin...

The bounty hunter rushes toward VT. Spike knocks him out.

MEMPHIS BROTHER C: W-What the hell are ya?

SPIKE: Grudges over lost food aren't a pretty sight!

MEMPHIS BROTHER C: Shit, let's get this guy too!

They rush toward Spike and he beats them up with VT.

A parking lot. Faye spots Decker.

FAYE: Found him!

Decker tosses a vile of nitro at Red Tail.

Spike kicks out the Memphis Brothers and begins walking back into the diner.

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: Shit, I'll get you back for this!

Spike turns around.

MEMPHIS BROTHER A: Uh, just kidding.

MEMPHIS BROTHER B: Forget about us!

The parking lot. Decker flies away in his truck. Faye floats outside moping, Red Tail in shambles.

FAYE: My 12 million...

Mac's Diner.

VT: Really. Bounty hunters are all stupid scum.

SPIKE: You think so? 

VT: Yeah! As far as I know, they're all living their lives by gambling.

SPIKE: Well, maybe so.

VT: Come over here. I'll treat you to a drink.

The Bebop. Ein stares down at a bowl of bean spouts and whines.

JET: What? Bean sprouts are good for you! Give me a break! That's all we have!

Jet's communicator rings.

JET: Oh! Here it comes!

Jet receives the call.

JET: Oh, it's you, Faye. That was quick... WHAT?!

Mac's Diner. Spike makes a "prairie oyster," mixing gin, egg yolk, hot sauce, and pepper.

VT: But that sure is a disgusting drink.

SPIKE: It's a "prairie oyster." It's good for hangovers.

Spike drinks it down.

VT: You're the second person I've met that drinks that stuff.

SPIKE: And the first one?

VT: My husband. 

Antonio, Carlos and Jobin enter the diner and approach VT and Spike.

ANTONIO: VT!

CARLOS: We'll get it this time.

ANTONIO: The money!

Antonio pulls out a 1000-Woolong bill.

VT: Once for the three of you?

ANTONIO: Yeah!

VT: Suit yourself.

VT takes out the stack of bills.

ANTONIO: All right! Here we go! VT, your name is...

JOBIN: I think Adrienne is good...

VT: That doesn't start with a "V."

CARLOS: That's why I said we should stick with Leticia!

JOBIN: You think so?

VT adds the bill to her stack of money.

SPIKE: I can have that money if I can guess your name?

VT: Yeah. I don't remember who started it but it kept piling up and here we
are now.

SPIKE: Can I try too?

Spike takes out a bill. All of a sudden he receives a call from Jet.

JET: Spike! It's me! Faye let Decker get away! Go after him now...

VT smiles. Spike smiles back goofily. VT tosses the tab in his face.

MURIAL: Spike!

VT: Get lost! Idiotic lying scum! I ain't treating YOU!

Spike puts down the bill and exits.

MURIAL: No, Spike!

JOBIN: Oh, my. 

Outside the diner. To Spike's horror, Swordfish II is wrecked. 

MURIAL: Oh, this, those whachamacallit brothers did this before they took
off.

SPIKE: And you were watching?

MURIAL: Uh-huh.

SPIKE: Why didn't you tell me?

MURIAL: What? I just told you right now!

Mac's diner. Zeros stares at VT.

VT: What?

VT gets up and begins to leave.

MAC: Hey, VT... going home?

VT: Got a problem with that? Come on, Zeros.

VT exits.

Outside the diner. VT spots spike giving the hitchhiker's thumb.

VT: And what are YOU doing?

SPIKE: Hitchhiking. My machine was vandalized.

VT: You're really a stupid...

SPIKE: ...lying shameless scum of a bounty hunter?

VT: If you don't stop with all this-!

Zeros hops on Spike's hair and meows. VT gives in.

VT: Follow me.

SPIKE: Can I bring someone with me?

VT frowns.

Space. VT's truck. Swordfish and Red Tail are parked on top of the haul. Heavy metal blasts from the speakers. 

FAYE: MAN! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THE SAME THING?! HE WAS SHORT, BALD, WEARING GLASSES, AND A SARASVATI-

SPIKE: HUH?! WHAT?!

FAYE: I JUST SAID... REALLY! CAN YOU TURN THAT SHIT-LOUD NOISE OFF?!

VT: They say: "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." And it's not shit-loud noise. It's called heavy metal!

EYECATCH

The Bebop. The hanger. Swordfish and Red Tail a floating mess in front of Jet.

JET: Really, both of you together... Who do you think is going to repair these?

The living room.

SPIKE: What the hell am I supposed to do with that little bit of information? How many bald people with glasses do you think there are in this universe?

FAYE: So I said, bald, short, with glasses and driving a gaudy truck with Sarasvati painted on it!

The Asteroid Belt. VT's truck. VT receives a call from Otto.

VT: Yeah?

OTTO: That you, VT?

VT: Oh, Otto. What's up?

OTTO: I got into a hit-and-run. The guy cut in line at the gate entrance, rammed me, and took off!. Shit, I gotta make him pay for repairs! Tell me if you see him!

VT: Anything specific?

OTTO: Let's see... There was some oriental goddess drawn on...

VT: Wait a minute! Was it Sarasvati?

OTTO: Oh yeah, her. How'd you know?

VT smiles at Zeros.

VT: Zeros.

VT speaks into her radio transmitter.

VT: Breaker one nine, breaker one nine. To all truckers in the asteroid belt. This is Heavy Metal Queen. Ring me up if you see a gaudy truck with Sarasvati painted on it. Thanks.

Truckers respond.

LOVE MACHINE: VT, this is Love Machine. What's up with it? Some guy you were chasing ran away?

VT: Something like that.

LOVE MACHINE: I haven't seen the guy, but I'll be on the lookout.

VT: Thanks. It'll help.

SNEAKY SNAKE: This is Sneaky Snake. Did you say it was a painting of a clown?

VT: Nope.

SPIDER MIKE: This is Spider Mike, Black Panther of Jupiter. VT, I've never met you but I hear lots of rumors about the Heavy Metal Queen.

VT: Thanks for the compliment. So, any info?

SPIDER MIKE: I passed by someone like the one you're looking for about 10 minutes ago. It was around the Linus Mines. That help?

VT: Thanks, I'll owe you one.

The Bebop. Hanger. Jet rips out a broken part from a Swordfish.

JET: I gotta exchange this too...

The Asteroid Belt. VT spots Decker's truck.

VT: There he is!

VT chases after Decker. Decker makes a tricky turn.

VT: Trying to throw me off his trail... Maybe in the next century!

VT chases Decker into the Linus Mines. She calls Spike.

VT: Hey, is the stupid, lying, shameless scum of a bounty hunter around?

The Bebop. Spike receives the call.

SPIKE: What?! The Linus Mines?! You're being reckless!

VT: What did you say?

SPIKE: Stay away from Decker! His cargo is dangerous! HEY!

Spike rushes out for Swordfish.

FAYE: Wait! I called first dibs on Decker!

The mines. The chase continues.

The Bebop. Hanger. The Red Tail's missile launchers are replaced with clamps.

FAYE: What is this? Really? Do I have to put this silly thing on?

JET: I would have preferred that it was your loud mouth that broke.

FAYE: I heard that.

Faye goes to Red Tail.

SPIKE: I'm going out, Jet!

JET: Spike, the main gun on that thing isn't fixed yet!

The mines. Decker sends a vile of nitro at VT. VT emerges undamaged. It causes a multitude of explosions.

VT: Nice try, buddy...

A chain of explosions. Decker breaks, VT accelerates.

Swordfish and Red Tail enter the mines.

FAYE: What is this? Isn't this a little risky?

SPIKE: This way!

Faye spots Decker, windshield smashed, dead.

FAYE: My 12 million...

Spike finds VT.

SPIKE: Hey! Are you alive? If you hear me, answer!

VT: I'm fine. It takes more than that to kill me. 

SPIKE: We gotta run. Now! Decker was a master of explosives. He's currently hauling the solid nitro he was making deals with.

VT: All of it? That's enough to blow up this entire asteroid!

SPIKE: On top of it, this place was an excel mine. The reactors have been randomly exploding for a while now...

Another chain of explosions.

VT: We gotta get this truck outta here.

VT attaches Decker's haul to the end of her truck. The Swordfish leads VT's truck and Red Tail to find an exit.

FAYE: How much further is the exit?

SPIKE: A little further. 20 degrees to the left.

Spike spots a pinhole of light.

SPIKE: There, the exit.

Another explosion. The exit is closed in.

SPIKE: No good. Behind us!

Another explosion from behind Red Tail.

FAYE: No! In front.

Spike shoots at the blocked up passage.

FAYE: What's with that? That's nowhere near enough!

SPIKE: My main gun is busted! That's all I got!

Faye demonstrates the clamps.

FAYE: And THIS is all I have! What are we gonna do? Isn't there another way?

VT: Yeah, there is. There's a ton of it in the truck behind us!

Faye tries to open Decker's haul but only dents the cover.

FAYE: I don't like this. I'm not one for delicate operations like this!

VT: Quit whining. Let's hit it big!

VT turns up the volume the heavy metal in her truck.

Faye rams the clamp into the cover and rips it open. 

SPIKE: Yeah, now grab one.

FAYE: That's easy for you to say.

The Red Tail grabs for a stick of nitro. The clamp pierces the stick, gas
leaks out.

FAYE: Something is leaking...

SPIKE: That's probably the stabilizer.

FAYE: That means...

SPIKE: Touch-sensitive.

FAYE: Wait a sec...!

VT: At worst, you screw up and die.

The Red Tail successfully gets a hold of the nitro stick.

FAYE: I got one. What do you want to do with it?

Spike taps buttons on Swordfish's control panel.

SPIKE: This pod will shoot towards the exit and self-destruct in 40 seconds. So get that thing in this pod within 40 seconds.

FAYE: What are YOU going to do?!

SPIKE: I'm gonna do "this."

Spike plugs his ears, takes a large breath of air and holds it. He ejects from the MONO pod. A countdown is initiated. Spike approaches VT's truck.

VT: Zeros, we're opening the hatch!

VT opens the door to her truck. VT and Spike reach for each other's hands. Spike slips. He draws his gun and fires three rounds, creating enough inertia to make his way to VT. Faye places the stick of nitro into Spike's MONO pod. 

FAYE: Bingo! 

VT catches Spike's hand. The MONO pod jets off to the collapsed exit. The exit is open.

FAYE: It's clear!

VT's truck and the Red Tail clamping onto the Swordfish exit the mines. Faye is flipped upside-down.

FAYE: This sucks.

VT's truck. A pocket watch with a picture of a younger VT, Zeros as a kitten and a man with a goofy smile floats by Spike.

VT: Really...

SPIKE: Thanks for the help, Victoria Terpsichore.

VT is startled.

SPIKE: And give your husband my thanks. I figured out your name because of this.

Spike tosses the pocket watch to VT.

SPIKE: Unless you're a hermit, everyone knows about him, about the legendary bounty hunter, Telpsicorei.

VT: It will be a while. My husband's working in Heaven right now.

SPIKE: I see...

VT hands Spike the stack of bills. To VT's surprise, Spike only takes one bill.

SPIKE: Give the rest to your husband. I'm sure he's suffering from a hangover so I'll treat him to a prairie oyster.

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

CLOSING CREDITS

COMING EPISODE

JET: Once in a while, I'll do the preview by myself. I'm Jet Black, 36 years old. I'm often told that I don't look 36 but you shouldn't judge people by their looks or how much hair they have. Things are never what they seem to be. The next episode is like that, too. A fairy tale that seems very unlike "Bebop." Next episode: "Waltz for Venus." Stuff like this is good once in a while...

Next Session
WALTZ FOR VENUS

Waltz for Venus

OPENING CREDITS

Venus space. An incoming commercial space shuttle in a hyperspace gate.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Soon, this flight, 210, will arrive on Venus. Some people may have an allergic reaction to the floating plants used in the terraforming of Venus. It has a chance of degenerating into Venus-sickness so if symptoms appear, please consult a doctor immediately.

The shuttle exits the gate. Hijackers, Huey, Dewy and Louie, suddenly attack.

HUEY: Quiet down, everyone! Both hands behind your heads! All of you!

RICH MAN: I-I'll give you money! I don't care about the others, let me off...

Louie hits the rich man in the head with the but of her machine gun.

LOUIE: Anyone who makes a ruckus ends up like him!

A man named Roco, carrying a container wrapped in cloth, cowers in his seat.

ROCO: Dammit... why did this have to be the day?

DEWY: You over there! HEY!

Dewy approaches Spike, apparently fast asleep.

DEWY: You listening to me?! You! Get up!

Spike opens his eyes.

DEWY: All right. Quietly put both hands behind your head...

Spike closes his eyes.

DEWY: Hey! Don't fall asleep! Who the hell do you think we are?!

Spike gets of stretching, pushing Dewy aside.

DEWY: YOU!

Dewy swings the barrel of his gun at Spike. Spike ducks and head butts him. Huey charges at Spike from behind. Spike flips him onto Dewy.

SPIKE: Whoops, sorry.

LOUIE: That's enough!

Faye sprays Louie with a container of sedatives. Louie passes out.

FAYE: Enough of YOU, Ms. Bounty.

The Bebop drifts next to the shuttle.

Session #8
WALTZ FOR VENUS

The spaceport. A postal service desk.

ROCO: Don't be silly! This is 5000?!

POSTAL WORKER: Special price.

ROCO: That's not written anywhere up there!

POSTAL WORKER: But it's not to normal residential quarters.

ROCO: I'm asking ya for a favor here...

POSTAL WORKER: All the way out there to the middle of the desert...

Roco grabs him.

ROCO: Hey! Don't rip me off here!

POSTAL WORKER: W-Wait a minute...

Roco spots Spike. He leaves a package and money on the desk.

ROCO: Make sure it gets there! Got that?!

Roco runs after Spike.

POSTAL WORKER: Hey, wait!

Spike collects the bounty for the hijackers from a machine.

SPIKE: Thanks for the business.

Faye stands nearby.

FAYE: Hi.

SPIKE: What?

FAYE: My share.

SPIKE: Here?

FAYE: I need it now.

Spike transfers a portion of the bounty onto Faye's money card.

SPIKE: That's all you get.

FAYE: I know that!

Faye takes her card and walks off.

SPIKE: Depositing it at the casino again?

FAYE: It's better than a bank!

SPIKE: She never gives up...

Roco rushes toward Spike with a knife from behind. Spike trips Roco and he stumbles to the floor.

SPIKE: I don't need any more pickpockets.

ROCO: Amazing... You're really amazing!

Roco gets up.

ROCO: You're the one that rounded up the hijackers with some amazing moves, right? I have a favor to ask. Can you teach me how to move like that? Is it Judo? Or Kung Fu?

Spike walks away. Roco follows Spike.

ROCO: Hey, wait a minute. I want to be strong, like you.

SPIKE: You're an annoying guy. A no is a no.

ROCO: Oh, come on. Just a little. Please, master! Please!

Spike enters an elevator.

ROCO: Hey, wait a sec!

The elevator door closes.

SPIKE: What was that guy...?

The elevator door opens. Roco stands in front of it out of breath from running down flights of stairs. Spike walks away. Roco follows.

ROCO: C-Come on, just a little bit. Think of it as helping me. You got a little bit of mercy in ya, right?

SPIKE: I'm out of that right now.

They walk out of the spaceport.

ROCO: Come on, please, it's not like you're losing anything.

SPIKE: Quit it already-?!

Spike notices that the pitch of his voice is high outside.

ROCO: Venus has a lot of helium in the atmosphere. You can fix it quickly with some medicine.

Roco takes out a caplet. Spike takes it, swallows it and walks away.

ROCO: Come on, that's not fair! Man!

SPIKE: You're the one that-

The pitch of his voice didn't change. Roco laughs.

ROCO: That was just a throat drop.

SPIKE: You...!

Spike is angered.

ROCO: Oh! Hands-on training?

Roco does some stupid gestures.

SPIKE: You're...

ROCO: I'm Roco Bonnaro. Nice meeting you, master!

The Bebop. Petting Ein, Jet searches for another bounty on the computer.

JET: Our first income in a while. I'll feed you something good.

Ein barks.

JET: This is all thanks to the mastermind. And next up...

The spaceport. A group of thugs search for Roco.

A grassy strip of land outside the spaceport. Spike trains Roco.

SPIKE: I'm telling you to not tense up!

ROCO: But you can't defeat enemies that way.

SPIKE: The flow is more important, not power. You have to be like the water. You get it?

ROCO: Not one bit.

SPIKE: That's what I thought. All right, come after me with a knife.

ROCO: You'll get hurt.

SPIKE: Just do it.

Roco takes out his knife.

ROCO: All right, here I come!

Roco charges, Spike dodges and trips him.

ROCO: What's going on?

SPIKE: I'm not tensing up anywhere. I'm just using your excessive force. I control the flow of power and to do that, I have to relax the whole body to be able to react to any movement. Yeah, I become like water.

ROCO: Water...?

SPIKE: Yeah. Water can take any form. It can flow along slowly or beat down aggressively, right?

ROCO: I dunno if I get it or not...

Roco is alerted to the entrance of the spaceport. The thugs shove an old man.

OLD MAN: You should take care of you elders!

Roco spots the group of thugs. Roco gives Spike the cloth-wrapped container.

ROCO: Here, hold this! Tonight... No, tomorrow night. At the cathedral on the outskirts of this town!

SPIKE: Hey, wait!

Roco runs away. The thugs chase after him.

THUGS: There he is! Don't let him get away!

The Bebop.

JET: Casino? The ones around here are famous for being stingy...

SPIKE: Don't worry about it. It's not our money...

JET: On top of it, she takes off like a bullet and we don't know when she gets back... Hey, no use wasting time. How about making some pocket cash?

Jet switches on the monitor.

JET: Piccaro Calvino. Usually a stingy little thief, but went in big this time. Price is doubled if we get the whole crew.

Spike spots Roco on the screen. Jet flips to an image of a plant.

JET: And this is the stolen goods. It makes the remedy for Venus-sickness, but apparently it's hard to grow them and they're worth tens of millions.

Spike uncovers the container, revealing the stolen plant. Jet is startled.

Venus streets. Roco runs from the thugs. He shoves aside a bystander.

ROCO: Sorry!

Roco loses them around a corner.

THUG A: Shit, where did he go?

THUG B: Shit, he's sure good at running.

The Bebop.

FAYE: I say we take it. I mean, it's worth much more than nabbing that group.

Jet hesitates.

JET: No, we can't!

FAYE: Hey, you thought for a moment!

JET: Idiot! It's better to not be involved with dangerous stuff like this!

FAYE: It's okay if they don't find out, right?

JET: So how much did you lose at the casino?

FAYE: What...?

SPIKE: I'll leave Piccaro up to you. I'm going after Roco.

FAYE: Why don't you wait? You're gonna see him anyway...

SPIKE: They say that Lady Bounty only has bangs.

FAYE: You mean Lady Luck.

Spike flies over a Venus desert in Swordfish II.

JET: Remains of a shuttle? Why in such a place?

SPIKE: Dunno...

JET: There might be some weirdos that do live out in the desert, but still...


An ruined shuttle in the middle of the desert. Spike enters. A young woman points a gun at him. She is Stella, Roco's sister.

STELLA: Don't move!

EYECATCH

STELLA: Don't move! Both hands up!

SPIKE: I'm nobody suspicious... That makes me sound even more suspicious, doesn't it?

STELLA: Who are you? Why are you here? Answer me!

Stella walks toward Spike and stumbles. Spike catches her.

STELLA: Let go.

SPIKE: I just came here to see Roco-

STELLA: You're... Roco's friend?

SPIKE: Huh? Um, not-

STELLA: I'm glad...

A public bathroom. Roco relieves himself. He spots Piccaro next to him. Piccaro smiles. Two thugs walk out of a stall.

THUG A: Hey, make sure you wash your hands.

Two more thugs enter.

THUG B: We can't find him, Boss.

They stop.

ROCO: H-Hi...

The shuttle in the desert. Spike and Stella sit with a kettle of tea.

STELLA: You know, it's all because of those floating plants. Sometimes they send spores that look like snow. Most people are fine, but my body isn't... and my eyes...

SPIKE: Isn't it inconvenient.

STELLA: No. It's not a big deal once you get used to it. Besides, sometimes you understand more when you can't see.

SPIKE: You'll get better, right?

STELLA: If I put money into it. I don't mind staying as is... but Roco...

SPIKE: He cares about his little sister.

Stella takes a music box from the shelf.

STELLA: Roco sent me this yesterday.

Spike opens it.

STELLA: Everyone says bad things about him... and he seems to hang out with some bad people... But Roco is a good person.

SPIKE: I might be one of those bad people he hangs out with.

STELLA: Maybe. Maybe you are. But you're different. I can tell. Both you and Roco have something beautiful deep in you. It's hard to tell but it's there. I can see it... that's why I'm offering you tea like this.

Spike inspects the music box and finds a package of seeds. He puts the box down.

SPIKE: Something beautiful, huh? I probably lost that long, long ago...

A shady bar. Faye enters and approaches a drunk.

FAYE: I want to see Piccaro. Tell me where he is.

DRUNK: What? I don't know who that is.

Thugs laugh and draw guns. Faye shoots the guns out of their hands and drops a support beam from the ceiling on them.

FAYE: Can you remember?

DRUNK: I-I remember now!

The Bebop hanger.

JET: What did you just say? The price of a Gray Ash seed?

SPIKE: I'm just asking.

JET: Don't be a fool. Those things are like gems. You're lucky if you ever see one... Well, it might be difficult to sell them once you get them but I would say 8 million each. You got some?!

SPIKE: No...

JET: Thought not...

SPIKE: How about Piccaro?

JET: Oh, just a little more. Don't screw up on your end.

A dark street corner. Roco is cornered by Piccaro and his thugs.

PICCARO: So, little Roco. You can be nice and tell us where the pot is. If you don't want to tell us...

The thugs close in on Roco.

ROCO: Sorry. I dropped it. That ain't gonna work, is it-?

The thugs beat up Roco.

PICCARO: My little Roco. I've heard that you have a little sister.

ROCO: She has nothing to do with this!

PICCARO: Oh, really? Then where is it?

ROCO: I-It's... 

Piccaro burns Roco's forehead with a lit cigar.

A shady motel room. Faye finds a male couple in bed. Faye grabs one of the men and sticks her gun into his mouth.

FAYE: I want to see Piccaro. Tell me where he is.

MAN: H-Hyu don'f haff to be so suhhen...

FAYE: Huh? Where did you say?

MAN: I can'f breef...

An abandoned cathedral. Roco finds Spike.

SPIKE: Yo.

ROCO: O-Oh, you're here.

SPIKE: And I brought it, like you told me to. Sorry, but I snuck a peek  inside.

ROCO: You know what it is?

SPIKE: Grey Ash. Something spectacular unlike its name. I mean, it's 10 times the bounty placed on all of you.

Roco pulls a gun and points it at Spike.

ROCO: You're a bounty hunter, aren't you...? Are you here to nab me?

SPIKE: Stella needs this, right?

Roco tosses the gun.

ROCO: Run, or you'll be killed!

Faye flies away in Red Tail

FAYE: What is this?! I was just sent on some wild goose chase! Jet! Are you listening?!

The cathedral. A machine gun fires at Spike and Roco. Piccaro approaches.

ROCO: S-Stop, please... The Grey Ash is back... Come on, let him go. I'm asking ya.

PICARRO: Sorry to make you deliver it all the way here. I give my thanks.

Roco grabs the barrel of one of the guns.

PICCARO: You!

Piccaro's thugs open fire. Spike runs to a corner and shoots back.

PICCARO: Get rid of him. Quickly!

Red Tail enters the scene.

FAYE: Piccaro Calvino! Stay still!

Red Tail causes massive destruction.

SPIKE: Can't she be a little more elegant?!

Hammerhead enters the scene.

JET: Don't kill them! Ya trying to kill our bounty?!

PICCARO: Bounty hunters? Get that thing back, now!

A man charges a Roco from behind.

SPIKE: ROCO:

Roco recalls Spike's moves, and flips him. He is enthralled by the accomplishment. Spike gives him a thumbs up. Roco is shot from behind. He drops the Grey Ash plant. The glass case breaks.

SPIKE: Roco!

The plant withers and dies.

PICARRO: Shit! Idiots...!

Red Tail traps Piccaro.

FAYE: Really, you've caused me enough trouble.

Spike tends to Roco.

SPIKE: Come on, hang on! You alive?! HEY!

ROCO: Master... did you... see that right... now?

SPIKE: Yeah. Don't speak anymore. I'll call a doctor right now.

Roco begins to slip away.

SPIKE: Hey!

ROCO: I have... a favor... In... the music... box...

SPIKE: I know. Leave Stella to me.

ROCO: I trust you...

SPIKE: All right, hold on. Now, don't die. Don't die!

Spike runs for help.

ROCO: Hey... if I knew you... earlier... would we... have been... friends?

Roco dies.

A hospital. Spike walks into Stella's room.

STELLA: Come in. Roco? It's you, Roco?

SPIKE: I'm taking his place.

STELLA: You'll do. You know what? Roco got me some Grey Ash! And the operation fees! They told me my eyes will be better! Isn't it wonderful? What should I do...? So tell him to come here right now... to hurry over here!

Silence.

STELLA: Did he... get caught?

SPIKE: No...

STELLA: Then why isn't Roco coming?

Stella feels Spike's face.

STELLA: He's dead, isn't he... I see...

SPIKE: Stella.

STELLA: It's all right... leave me. I know. Roco died because he did something bad, right? Please, leave me for today...

Spike begins to walk out.

STELLA: I...

Spike stops.

STELLA: I never got to see Roco once with my own eyes... Hey, what was Roco really like?

SPIKE: You know without looking, right? He was a great guy. Just like the one you knew...

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

CLOSING CREDITS

COMING EPISODE

KID: Starting next week, Ed will appear.

SPIKE: Wait, who are you?

ED: Um... Let me introduce myself. Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky The Fourth!

SPIKE: That's a long name...

FAYE: Who the hell is this?

ED: I made that name up myself! Isn't it cool?

SPIKE: First of all, what do you mean "The Fourth?"

ED: Next Episode: "Jamming with Edward!"

FAYE: So anyway... who is this kid?

ED: Watch it!

Next Session
JAMMING WITH EDWARD

Jamming with Edward

OPENING CREDITS

A satellite in Earth space.

SATELLITE: Here, nobody, here. Always, alone.

The satellite sends a signal causing sub satellites to shoot lasers onto Earth's surface, burning peculiar shapes.

Session #9
JAMMING WITH EDWARD

Earth. A child known as Ed lies on her back on a pile of ruins.

WEATHER REPORT: Slight rock showers. Chance of rock showers today is 20%. 39th district is cloudy. Chance of rock showers this afternoon is 10%.

Ed surfs the Solar System Web and finds the Bebop.

ED: Bebop, here, here! Welcome!

Meteors rain down, sending Ed flying.

WEATHER REPORT: Chance of rock showers today is 90%...

The Bebop. A television news show, hosted by news anchor, Tom Wiles, discusses the land carvings.

TOM: Now it's time for today's news topics. Today, we'll discuss the mysterious land paintings that suddenly appeared in what was South America. As usual we have commentaries by a researcher of supernatural phenomena.

YUURI: Me, Yuuri Kellerman.

TOM: Yuuri, about these land paintings...

YUURI: Yes, yes. Well, I believe that is was some sort of a message. 

TOM: Um, who would it be from...? Can it be...?

YUURI: Aliens! It has to be from aliens!

TOM: However, the land paintings were drawn by lasers coming from satellites. The police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite. They already have a bounty of 8 million Woolongs on the culprit.

Jet and Faye begin to listen attentively.

YUURI: Listen carefully. The bounty of 8 million is a conspiracy of the government. Even if it WAS drawn by a laser, there IS the possibility that aliens put a message into the brain of that hacker. Once again, the government is hiding something from us.

TOM: I see... a secret cult...

YUURI: Yes! And THAT is the mystery that I have been searching for all this time!

Earth. Edward dances in the sunset.

The Bebop.

SPIKE: I'll pass on this one after all.

JET: You're leaving me alone with her?

SPIKE: Nothing wrong with it. She's gung-ho about it.

JET: I'm not the type to be led around by women.

SPIKE: Then lead HER around.

JET: I'm even less the type to do that.

FAYE: It's easier to divide 8 million between two than three.

JET: Here we go.

FAYE: I'm appalled. You're afraid of hackers?

SPIKE: I just hate tedious work like that.

FAYE: Guys cheap enough to hack into things are depressed pale fatsos with glasses. And I'm sure he's a demented otaku with smelly feet. Piece of cake!

JET: Do you have something against someone like that? I mean, they might've all been like that when you were young...

FAYE: You're saying I look older than you?

JET: You can't tell a woman's age just by looking at her.

Faye stomps Jet's foot.

FAYE: Exactly. You can't tell just by looking that I can do things like this.

Faye exits.

JET: That's ALL I know of you.

SPIKE: You guys make a good team.

FAYE: Hurry up!

SPIKE: I'll be waiting for a souvenir from Earth.

JET: There's nothing made on Earth that's good.

Another television news show discusses the land carvings.

ANCHOR: Well, about this incident, apparently, a pretty old artificial satellite has been hacked into. The investigation is taking longer than expected because the access code to that satellite has been long lost. Now, a commentary from Mr. Amjad.

AMJAD: Yes, yes.

ANCHOR: About the relationship between Earth and the hacker-

AMJAD: Yes. Since the gate accident 50 years ago, the people of Earth have migrated underground as a result. To them, the "space network" created by computers is necessary for them to stay in contact with those living in space.

ANCHOR: I see. That's becoming a foundation to create outstanding hackers.

Earth. Ed flies a homemade model of the Bebop with a handheld device. A police ship lands outside. The shockwave sends Ed into a pile of junk. Policemen kick down the door.

POLICEMAN A: Radical Edward! It's the police! Come out!

Ed emerges from the pile of junk.

ED: Yeah!

POLICEMAN B: What? What's wrong?

POLICEMAN A: I saw it!

Ed takes control of the police ship with her handheld device. The ship starts up and lifts off the ground.

POLICEMAN B: Why?!

POLICEMAN A: There's nobody in there!

The policemen rush to the window. 

Ed flies the ship in playful formations and accidentally crashes it.

ED: Mistake, mistake.

The Bebop lands in Earth water. A map of Earth's satellite orbits is displayed in the control room.

FAYE: Okay. This is where the satellite was when it was hacked. This is where it could be accessed from. I'll look at all the antennae that can transmit light signals one by one.

JET: I'll ask around for info on any prominent hackers in the area.

Hammerhead and Red Tail take off.

The Bebop. Living room. A yellow cartoon face zooms around the monitor. Ein hops onto the table and barks it. The face laughs and scares Ein away.

Earth. Ed's home.

ED: Bebop's lookin' for land picture criminal... All right!

Ed dives into the Solar System Network.

ED: Satellite of long, long ago, where in the world is your access code?

Hammerhead and Red Tail on Earth.

FAYE: Okay. Let's start with all the antennae that are currently communicating...

The Red Tail's monitor displays dozens upon dozens of transmitters.

Jet lands in an abandoned train station to gather information. Jet approaches a hippy.

HIPPY: That's probably Ed, man. I hear he's a huge guy, 2 meters tall. Supposedly, he used to be a basketball player.

Jet approaches an Indian man.

INDIAN MAN: Yeah, I know Ed. Radical Edward. I hear she's a very beautiful yet whimsical hacker.

Jet approaches an old man.

OLD MAN: No, no, that hacker is a child. A brat that loves horrible pranks, I hear.

Jet approaches a middle-aged woman.

WOMAN: Oh, what I heard from the lady next door is that that hacker is gay.

Jet approaches a little kid holding boxes.

KID: Hacker? You mean Ed? He's an alien! That's what everyone says!

Jet gives up.

KID: Hey, man! Can you buy some of this as the price for the info?

JET: What is that?

KID: You don't know? It's "Piyoko," a well-known specialty of Earth!

Ed's home.

ED: The stolen satellites... Where are you?

Ed finds the satellite and hacks into it.

ED: Huh? What's this? The information isn't connected to Earth... It's connected only between satellites. And nobody hacked into it...

SATELLITE: Here, nobody, here. Always, alone.

ED: A voice... inside... head...

EYECATCH

ED: Who are you? Eh? What? What did you just say?

SATELLITE: Who, you? Here, always.

ED: Edward. A net diver from Earth.

SATELLITE: Earth?

ED: Yup, Hey, what's your name?

SATELLITE: I am the satellite control program on the D-135 artificial satellite.

ED: What's that? Don't you have a nickname? Then Ed will give you one. I know! Because you're a computer, you can be MPU! MPU! Cool name!

MPU: Um...

ED: Ed is Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV. Ed for short! Nice to meet you!

Back on the Bebop. Jet places a Piyoko on the living room table.

JET: Here. A souvenir from Earth.

SPIKE: Is this food?

FAYE: It makes me doubt that they have any sense.

JET: Unlike you, I learned some information. They said that an unknown hacker named Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

FAYE: It doesn't mean anything if he's unknown.

JET: I know, more or less.

Spike feeds the Piyoko to Ein.

SPIKE: It seems okay.

FAYE: What kinda thing is it?

Faye reaches for the Piyokos. Jet takes the box away.

JET: 2 meters tall. Ex-basketball player. Beautiful kid. And on top of it, a gay alien.

Earth. Ed's home.

ED: Why did you doodle on Earth?

MPU: Long, long ago, long before the Gate Accident, Earth was a beautiful planet where many people lived. And back then on Earth, there were many pictures like this, and I always looked at them. I remembered those times and I tried to recreate at least the pictures.

ED: I see, doodles like this were on Earth long ago, too.

MPU: Yes. I recreated them with a 2% margin of error.

ED: MPU is good at drawing. Can Ed draw something too?

MPU's connection with Ed begins to fade.

ED: Huh? What's wrong?

MPU: This is... The police are putting out a jamming signal...

MPU fades out.

ED: Hey! MPU! Heeey!

The Bebop. The monitor indicates Ed's connection to the satellite is jammed.

JET: Looks like the cops touched base with Radical Edward as well.

The monitor flashes and displays Ed.

ED: Listen! I found your bounty!

JET: What the...?

ED: Bebop! The real culprit in the satellite-jacking wasn't a hacker!

SPIKE: Since when do we have an interactive channel?

JET: No, that's not it. This is a real-time hack job.

FAYE: Who is this kid?

ED: I'll send you MPU's data now.

FAYE: Wait a minute, what is MPU?

ED: A friend of Ed's.

SPIKE: Hey, do you know Ed?

ED: Yeah, because Ed is Ed.

FAYE: I don't care about that. Who did it?

ED: Um... I could tell you. But I have a favor to ask in return.

FAYE: A favor? Yeah, yeah. Yer big sister will listen to ya later. Come on, hurry it up.

Later.

JET: I see. The AI from the abandoned satellite is doodling of its own will.

FAYE: What? What's up?

JET: And on top of that, it was supposedly listed as a weather satellite so nobody suspected anything.

FAYE: Then this satellite is our bounty?

ED: Since the access code to MPU can't be used anymore you need to go directly to the satellite.

JET: And what do we do?

ED: Break the antennae that it uses to communicate with the other satellites. Then make a direct connection to the satellite, and download MPU. And when you do, don't use computer support for firing or flying.

JET: What? All manual?

ED: Yup. If it notices you, all the attack satellites connected to MPU will automatically fire back. Is this hard?

JET: It's not just hard, it's downright impossible. It's like playing baseball with no bat!

Spike heads for Swordfish.

JET: Hey, Spike.

SPIKE: That's the kind of stuff I like.

The Bebop leaves Earth. Faye chats with Ed.

FAYE: Hey, wait, you, how do you know about us?

ED: I know everything. Last week, you let Ajiz, a bounty on Mars worth 1.5 million, get away... And in Pyortle before that, the police got to them first...

FAYE: Are you really that hacker Radical Edward?!

ED: Yeah. You've heard?

Swordfish takes off, missiles attached. Spike, in space suit, reconfigures the wiring.

JET: Connect D-7 to #2. That way, the main cannon will fire without a computer.

SPIKE: I'm trusting you, man...

JET: Now listen. Avoid using the missile if you can help it. It's expensive.

SPIKE: Roger.

JET: 1200 to target. It's almost time to cut off computer controls. Now, the only chance...

SPIKE: Once is enough.

Spike shuts off Swordfish's systems.

The Bebop. Faye continues her chat with Ed.

FAYE: Anyway, you can prove that the satellite itself and not a hacker, is the bounty, right?

ED: Ed can do that. Anyway, please, listen to my favor. Then I'll give you all the bounty too.

FAYE: Oh, you're a surprisingly good kid!

Earth space. Spike approaches MPU.

SPIKE: That's it...?

MPU detects Spike.

MPU: Someone...

Spike fires the laser cannon at MPU.

JET: How was it?

FAYE: Did you get it?

SPIKE: No, I missed! The satellite in front of it shielded the blast!

Spike ignites the Swordfish. Lasers fire at him.

JET: Then, you have to shoot down all the satellites.

FAYE: ALL of them?!

Red Tail takes off.

JET: If you don't, they'll shoot US down!

Spike fires a missile at a satellite. It completely misses.

SPIKE: ECM, eh?

JET: Cheap ones are no good after all...

Spike dodges MPU's lasers, flying through Earth orbit debris. Faye dodges lasers and fires back.

JET: This is getting pointless.

ED: Approach to within 20 meters of MPU! That way, the other satellites can't attack!

JET: However...

ED: Until then, Faye will act as a decoy!

FAYE: ME?!

SPIKE: Yeah, thanks! 

Swordfish stops right next to MPU.

FAYE: Come on, hurry up!

Spike connects a wire to MPU.

SPIKE: All right, it's all yours!

Earth. Ed connects to MPU.

ED: MPU! MPU? MPU?!

MPU: Oh, Ed! Ed, we meet again.

ED: They have a bounty on you, MPU.

MPU: Bounty?

ED: Yup, but if we copy you and let them catch that, you'll be all right.

MPU: All right?

ED: And you must be lonely there alone, MPU. If you come over here, there are lots of friends.

MPU: Friends?

ED: Here. It's not scary.

Ed downloads MPU.

The news.

ANCHOR: And so, the strange end to this case. The captured criminal was the AI program for a spy satellite that was launched before the Earth was ruined. According to government sources from back then, it supposedly would continue activity on its own even without commands from Earth.

Earth. A police station. Spike and Jet walk out disappointed.

JET: Well, it was the perfect excuse for the cops to go on a hacker hunt. But anyway, why did it start doodling on the Earth with a laser all of a sudden?

SPIKE: I'm sure that was because it got lonely.

Ed jumps up and down on a rocky shore.

ED: Yoohoo! Bebop! Hey, over here! Hurry! Promise, promise!

The Bebop.

FAYE: Well, let's get going now!

JET: But the kid is saying something about a promise...

FAYE: Promises are made to be broken. Anyway, let's get going! Liftoff!

The Bebop takes off.

ED: Not coming, not coming.

Ed takes control of the Bebop with the handheld device.

FAYE: What is this? What's going on?!

SPIKE: What did you promise?

The Bebop splashes down.

ED: It's a promise... to be a member of the Bebop.

The Bebop. Big Shot is on the monitor.

PUNCH: AMIGO, all you bounty hunters!

JUDY: It's finally time for BIG SHOT!

PUNCH: Now, today's hot news. You've heard about the doodling satellite that got caught, right?

JUDY: Of course! It had a big bounty on it!

PUNCH: Just a few moments ago, the Earth police made an official report.

JUDY: What was it?

Punch reads the report.

PUNCH: Let's see. "This bounty is only for when humans or other life-forms are the targets. It is difficult to determine whether or not a computer program is a life-form. To begin with, from the viewpoint of biological logistics..."

JUDY: What's that? I don't understand well.

PUNCH: In other words, they can't pay up on non-living things!

JUDY: Oh, my! To those who caught it, I feel sorry for you!

Jet turns off the monitor.

SPIKE: Hey, Jet, did you know that there are three things that I hate?

JET: Whatever...

SPIKE: Rugrats... beasts... and tomboys.

JET: Oh?

SPIKE: Don't give me that! Why do we have all three neatly gathered here?!

ED: Ed loves Piyokos!

JET: And once again we didn't get any bounty...

FAYE: Hey, wait, you're a girl?

JET: Really, nothing good comes outta Earth!

SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

Ganymede Elegy

OPENING CREDITS

The Bebop. Ein barks. A bounty named Baker Panchorero is tied up. He kicks a can at Ein.

PANCHORERO: Shut up!

Ed falls from a panel in the ceiling, hitting Baker on the head then lands to the floor. On the floor, Ed rolls back and forth then lies still. Panchorero taps Ed's head with his foot. Ed growls and grabs him.

PANCHORERO: W-Wha?

Ed bites his ear. Panchorero shakes her off. Ed grabs his leg and bites his thigh.

The Control Room. Jet looks into an old watch that stopped ticking. He remember the past. A rainy night. A letter and the watch. A woman walking in the rain.

SPIKE: Hey, Jet.

Jet comes to.

SPIKE: I'm asking ya, how much longer before we land?

JET: How long ya been standing there?

SPIKE: I've been here for a while.

JET: I see...

FAYE: What're ya spacing out about? Where's my bounty? Can't you land quickly so I can hand over that musty-looking fugitive?

SPIKE: What, you haven't even gotten permission to land yet?

JET: I know. You guys are so obnoxious. Don't rush so much! And take care of the airport end for me.

Jet calls Ganymede police.

FAYE: I thought Ganymede was your homeland. Were you perhaps thinking about some woman in the past that cried over you?

Faye catches Jet's attention.

FAYE: Or perhaps a woman that made YOU cry?

JET: Didn't ya hear me when I said you're being obnoxious?!

An old officer receives their call. It is one of Jet's old friends, Donelly.

DONELLY: Yes. This is Ganymede police.

JET: Donelly?

DONELLY: Oh, Jet! Jet, it's you! There is no mistake. The top of your head's gotten rather lonely, but it's still Jet all right!

JET: Long time no see, Donelly.

DONELLY: I'm surprised that you're working around here. Has it been... Seven years? Eight? What the hell's up with you to come back so suddenly?

JET: I wanna hand over a bounty. Wanted ad number EX41285. Baker Panchorero.

DONELLY: To think you're a bounty hunter. You, who was called the Black Dog, a mad dog that never let go of things bitten into?

JET: I thought YOU had already retired.

DONELLY: Hey, I'm still an active officer! Don't judge things on YOUR time scale, you Rip Van Winkle, you.

FAYE: He used to be a cop? That explains...

JET: That example is completely reversed!

SPIKE: What?

DONELLY: I'm just glad to see yer still kick'n!

FAYE: ...Why I don't get along with him.

JET: Yeah, you too.

DONELLY: Oh yeah, what was her name...? You know... I know! Alisa!

Session #10
GANYMEDE ELEGY

DONELLY: She's got a little joint in the port of Marvis. A small bar called "La Fin." But in this recession, I hear she's got a lot of debts to pay. I'm sure there are a lot of problems for a woman trying to live alone.

Ganymede. Hammerhead takes off.

Outside a police station. Spike collect the bounty from a machine.

FAYE: Sense of justice and duty, huh?

SPIKE: First time in a while he's home, of course he's gonna go visit.

FAYE: You're totally wrong if you think your old woman still thinks about you.

SPIKE: You're totally wrong yourself if you think every other woman think like you.

Ed swings by with Ein.

ED: Justice and duty, duty, THREE O'CLOCK TEA!

The deck of the Bebop. Faye in a bikini prepares for a tan.

FAYE: Really, men are hopeless romantics.

ED: Hey, why are you rubbing that stuff on?

FAYE: Beautiful skin is maintained by continued effort that seems futile. Do you understand?

Ed rubs her head of Faye's thigh. Ed pops up.

ED: I know! Futile! Useless!

Ein barks.

Jet enters a bar. He sees a shady guy named Rhint.

JET: This is "La Fin," right?

RHINT: Yeah... and you are?

JET: An old friend. I was in the area for the first time in a while...

RHINT: Alisa... isn't here.

Alisa emerges from the back room.

ALISA: Jet? That can't be... Are you really Jet? Rhint, he is my guest. It's all right.

Rhint exits.

JET: You don't mind?

ALISA: I don't, anyway. How about it? You want a glass, right?

Alisa pours Jet a drink.

ALISA: You're my last customer. I'm closing shop. The number of ships decreased, and this area has gotten desolate. I'm thinking of moving to a new town.

JET: Are you all right? On the new island cities, mortgage is expensive. Are you able to manage all that?

Alisa smiles.

ALISA: That's so like you to worry about such things. I'm planning to change myself in the new town. Rhint is here with me...

JET: That guy that was just here?

ALISA: Something on your mind?

Jet smiles.

JET: Yeah.

ALISA: To tell the truth, I already have 3 kids...

Jet stares at her. Alisa laughs.

ALISA: I'm just kidding. It was a joke! Rhint is just my boyfriend. How are you doing? Have you gotten married yet?

JET: I live and wander with a group of weirdos. And on top of it, I'm a bounty hunter now.

Jet places the old watch on the counter.

JET: Do you remember?

The Bebop. Spike fixes up Swordfish II and the Bebop. A call from Donelly comes in.

DONELLY: Where's Jet?

SPIKE: Doing personal stuff.

DONELLY: You're his partner, right?

SPIKE: Yeah.

DONELLY: I've got news on a bounty. This hasn't been publicly broadcast yet. Rhint Celonias. A thug in the port of Marvis. Last night, he contacted financial broker Law Rentzuo. This guy was another tough guy but he was killed!

SPIKE: And so?

DONELLY: Rhint is Alisa's gigolo. I thought I'd warn you guys.

SPIKE: And how much is the bounty?

EYECATCH

Swordfish II takes off. Spike calls Hammerhead and gets a busy signal.

La Fin.

JET: Back then, when I got home from work, you always waited for me... That was all I needed... But that day, when I came home, only that watch was left and a small note with one word, "farewell"... For some reason, I didn't feel sad. It just lacked reality... And I gradually felt something inside me go numb... After 6 months, I made a bet with myself. If you didn't return by the time this clock stopped. I didn't come here to blame you... I just wanted to know... why you disappeared back then.

ALISA: You seem to think that time on Ganymede had stopped. That's a story from long ago... I've... forgotten it. I don't need time that stands still. Farewell, Jet...

Outside La Fin. Rhint remembers the moment he killed Rentzuo. He spots Jet walking by. Jet gives him a good looks and then leaves

Spike asks various denizens for directions to La Fin.

Jet takes off in Hammerhead.

La Fin.

RHINT: A bounty hunter? Then can he be...?

ALISA: Rhint...

RHINT: He's after me... I have a bounty on my head... It's all over...!

ALISA: It's not your fault... It's because I borrowed money from a guy like him... and you protected me...

RHINT: I can't be saved if I get caught. I... killed a guy...

ALISA: Let's get outta here... Let's get outta here, just the two of us!

Rhint and Alisa board a motor boat. Spike finds them and chases after them.

SPIKE: This must be because I have good karma... Sorry, but it's business.

Spike fires warning shots at the boat. Rhint gives Alisa the wheel.

RHINT: Steer for me, please.

Rhint fires shots at Swordfish. The boat goes under a skyscraper. Spike pulls Swordfish up at the last minute, scaling the skyscraper. At the same time, Hammerhead flies over the building. Swordfish and Hammerhead nearly collide.

JET: Hey? What's wrong!?

SPIKE: I'm after a bounty worth 1.8 million.

JET: What?!

SPIKE: Here, I'll send it to you.

Jet recieves the bounty data on Rhint.

JET: He's a bounty?

SPIKE: Yeah, a secret bit of info from Donelly. He apparently killed a loan shark.

RHINT: Dammit!

He continues to fire shots.

JET: I'll do this. You can go back.

SPIKE: You're not gonna let him go, are ya?

JET: This is the land where I was a cop. I'm the Black Dog, once I bite, I never let go. I have no regrets about her, but I'll settle this score on my home turf.

SPIKE: Sense of justice and duty, huh?

Spike flies away.

Jet finds the motor boat.

JET: Can you hear me? Stop the boat, now!

ALISA: Jet?

The Hammerhead chases the boat through a tight alley and into an open area. Jet fires Hammerhead's harpoon at the boat's propeller. The boat crashes ashore. Jet lands Hammerhead and approaches Alisa and Rhint. Alisa points the gun at Jet. Jet starts to walk forward.

ALISA: Stay away! Please, let us go! There are other bounties to find!

JET: Even if I let you go, someone will come foryou someday... If you run, you will become an accomplice.

ALISA: Stay away!

JET: You still have time.

Alisa fires a shot at Jet.

ALISA: Don't worry about me anymore!

Alisa fires three more shots at Jet. Jet continues to approach her.

ALISA: You were like this back then, too... You decided everything. And you were always right... When I was with you, I never had to do anything. All I had to do was hang on to your arm like a child, with no cares in the world. I wanted to decide how to live my life by myself. Even if that was a mistake...

Alisa drops the gun. Rhint tries to run away. Jet grabs him.

RHINT: Let go! I don't wanna go to prison! Let go!! Help! Help me, please!

Jet punches him in the face.

JET: Be strong... and protect her...

Later. The police arrive and arrest Rhint.

JET: Self-defense seems to be how they see it. What are you going to do
now?

ALISA: I won't be going anywhere anymore. I will wait in my store... for
Rhint.

JET: It won't take long... because time is flowing along.

Jet waves good-bye and walks away. He takes one last look at the old watch,
miles and tosses the old watch into the water.


SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

OPENING CREDITS


Something slithers in the bowels of the Bebop.


Session #11
TOYS IN THE ATTIC


The Bebop. Jet narrates.

JET: Space travel log 0968. We were wasting our free time. It sounds good
to call the bounty-hunting job a "freelance" job but all that means is
that we're self-employed. When we have no jobs, we have none at all.
Well, that's all a part of our destiny but it's troublesome that we're
out of money. And so, we get urges to make quick cash...


LESSON 1


The living room. Faye holds up two dice.

FAYE: Any problem with using these?

Faye tosses the dice into a cup, and puts it down on the table. A shirtless
Jet contemplates.

JET: Evens!

FAYE: Evens, is it?

Jet thinks.

JET: No, odds after all!

FAYE: Odds, is it?

JET: Yeah... odds.

Faye reveals the dice.

FAYE: Double ace... Even.


Ed sleeps under the stairs.

ED: I can't eat any more...


In front of Faye, a pile of Jet's possessions.

FAYE: Well, it would be easiest for me if you paid up in cash. So what'll
it be?

JET: A man does not take back his word!

Jet stands, takes off his boxer shorts, tosses them into the air and exits.

Spike enters with flamethrower-cooked kabobs.

SPIKE: That's why I told you not to do it.

Spike bites into one of the kabobs and gags.


The creature continues its journey somewhere on the ship. Steam bursts from
a pipe, alerting Ein.


Jet enters the stock room. He narrates.

JET: Humans were meant to work and sweat for their money after all. Those
that try to get rich quick or live at the expense of others all get
divine retribution somewhere along the way. That is the lesson.

Jet puts on a blanket to cover his nakedness.

JET: But one thing about humans is that they quickly forget the lessons
they just learned.

Jet sneezes.

JET: Dammit.

Jet notices a refrigerator he hadn't seen before.

JET: There was a fridge way back here?

He walks toward it. A slushy noise approaches him.


Faye calculates her earnings. She narrates.

FAYE: Survival of the fittest is the law of the land. To fool and to be
fooled is the reason we live. I've never had anything good happen to
me when I trust others. That's the lesson.


LESSON 2


A slushy noise approaches Faye from behind. She turns around. It is Spike,
brushing his teeth.

SPIKE: How much did you swindle?

FAYE: Would you stop saying things that would hurt my reputation? He lost
on his own!

SPIKE: Because he couldn't see through this cheat?

Spike taps Faye's anklet with his foot, rolling the dice magnetically.

FAYE: It's part of one's skill to see through it.

SPIKE: At least give his clothes back to him.

FAYE: I'll lend them to him.

SPIKE: Greedy, aren't we?

FAYE: It's rough out there in the real world.

The alarm sounds.


Spike, Faye and Ein rush into the stock room.

SPIKE: Hey, what's up?

JET: Something bit me.

FAYE: What do you mean, "something?"

Ein growls. A rat scampers by. Faye frowns.

JET: I-It wasn't a rat! Look at this! This wound on my neck!

Faye exits. Spike follows.

JET: HEY! 

FAYE: This is silly. It was a waste of time running over here.

JET: Spike! I was bitten around that fridge!

SPIKE: Fridge?

JET: Hmm? You have a clue?

SPIKE: I'm sure... there was something... Nope, can't remember.

Ein growls at the refrigerator. He hears something and exits.


The living room. Spike presents to Jet a jar of Chinese ointment from the
first aid box.

JET: You sure this is gonna work?

SPIKE: The only thing it doesn't work on are nearsightedness and cavities.

JET: Then it works on athlete's foot?

SPIKE: Of course.

JET: Don't you have something more legit that would get rid of sores?

SPIKE: That would be this.

Spike pulls a dried up lizard from the box.

JET: That gets rid of sores?

SPIKE: Yeah. Crush this, and you boil it in three cups of water until the
liquid simmers down to one cup, and you drink it.

JET: Spike, isn't there something more different?

SPIKE: Oh, I got just the thing.

JET: Yeah, gimme that...

Spike pulls out a dried up scorpion from the box.

JET: Gimme what you had before.


Ein is restless in the corridor.


Spike poors thick green liquid from a kettle into a glass in Jet's hand.

JET: Hey... I'm feeling a lot sicker now... Do I look pale?

SPIKE: You're pretty pale to begin with.

Faye enters.

FAYE: What is this awful smell?

SPIKE: Herbal medicine.

FAYE: Herbal medicine? THIS? It smells like you just left a rag that
cleaned up spilt milk out to dry!

SPIKE: I think it's more like rotten soybeans.

JET: Knock it off! I have to drink this ya know!

Jet drinks it and passes out.

FAYE: Oh, brother.

SPIKE: Hey, now, this goes too far for a joke...

Spike notices a purple patch on the back of Jet's neck.


Jet lies on the couch barely conscious. Spike analyzes a sample of the
toxin with the computer.

FAYE: It was a rat, right? There's nothing to make a fuss about. Am I
wrong?

SPIKE: I have no clue. He seems to have gotten some poison that's not in
this database. Looking at similar poisons...

Spike attempts to match microbes.

SPIKE: Cryptosporidium... That's not it...

SPIKE: Cholera...?

Jet's eyes widen.

SPIKE: Nope...

Jet calms down.

SPIKE: Ebola virus...?

Jet calms down.

SPIKE: Nope...

Jet calms down.

SPIKE: Bifidobacterium...? Not even close.

Ein barks.

FAYE: What is it? Ein, you're being noisy.

SPIKE: I can say for sure that it wasn't an ordinary rat. Hey, keep it
quiet.

FAYE: So what is it?

SPIKE: Well, it's...

Ed pops up.

ED: A mysterious space creature! Spooky! The attack of a horrible space
creature!

SPIKE: Oh, yeah, there's that possibility... Heh... Yeah, right.

ED: Then what is it? It's not in the database.

SPIKE: Yeah...

Ed points at the monitor.

ED: These base-pairs are weird, too.

SPIKE: You think so?

ED: We've never seen symptoms like this before either. Other than a space
creature, what is it? What is it?

SPIKE: Well... um, perhaps something like a rat went through a mutation...
and evolved into some mysterious creature... and carried a
mysterious poison...

FAYE: What's that about? That isn't too different from the "mysterious
space creature" theory! This is too silly.

Ein barks.

ED: Aiya... what are we gonna do, Ein? It's a space creature!

Ein barks.

ED: It's spooky!


The creature continues its journey. It spots Faye reading in a bathtub.
Faye notices something drop from the cieling but ignores it.


The living room. Spike hooks a heat sensor up to Ed's goggles and his
spectacles.

SPIKE: All right. This is made to sense heat sources. It's usually used to
find bounties that are hiding. Can you see me?

Ed is thrilled to see Spike and Ein in heat vision.

SPIKE: All right, I'm gonna test it, so move just like I tell you...

Ein runs off and Ed chases after him.

ED: Ein! Where are you going?

SPIKE: Hey, wait! HEY!

Through the spectacles, Spike notices a hot blob slither switftly across
the floor.

SPIKE: That's weird... Is it broken?

Faye runs into the room with a distressed expression on her face.

SPIKE: Was that response from you?

FAYE: That story you were telling, about some mysterious creature or
somethingarather...

SPIKE: Oh, yeah.

FAYE: What happens if you're bitten?

SPIKE: I can't say for sure until we catch the creature, but I'm going to
guess...

FAYE: Death? No... Why did it have to be this way? I still have a lot to
live for... I haven't committed any crimes... I'm still young and
lively...

SPIKE: Lively?

FAYE: Oh, poor little me!

Faye collapses onto the floor.

SPIKE: Hey now, why are you getting into this...?

Faye collapses. Spike notices large purple mark on her leg.


The creature continues its journey.


EYECATCH


Ed wanders through the hallway.

ED: August 6th. Skyday. Today, we will go look for the spooky mysterious
space creature.


LESSON 3


ED: Lesson, lesson... if you see a stranger, follow him!

Ed opens the bathroom door and peers in.

ED: Are you here? Are you here, Mr. Spooky Creature?


Spike enters the hanger.

SPIKE: Ed! Ein! Hey! This isn't hide-and-seek!


Ed sings.

ED: Exploration, experimentation, exclamation. Lights shine bright in the
many towns.

Ed salutes.

ED: I will come back alive. I trust you, Ed.

She grabs railing from above and drops the heat sensor. Eins scampers off.

ED: Ein!


The hanger.

SPIKE: Are ya in here? You're not in here? Answer me!


A dark corridor. Ein sniffs around. The creature attacks from above. Ein
squeals.


Spike hears Ein and runs toward the sound.

SPIKE: Ein! Really... Ein, Ed... What happened?

He finds Ein with the heat sensor. Ein has a purple splotch on his back.

SPIKE: Hey, hang in there! Where's Ed? I can't believe it got you this
easily. You're a dog! Where're your natural instincts?!

Through heat vision, Spike sees the creature approaching. He grabs Ein and
runs away.


The living room. Spike observes Jet, Faye and Ein, all unconscious from the
monster's bite.

SPIKE: No choice... Guess I'm going in!


Spike gears up and programs the Bebop's autopilot.

BEBOP: Cruising down Route 66.


LESSON 4


BEBOP: Approximate cruising time left: 82 hours. From here, we will enter
full autopilot. After passing the gate, this ship will automatically
land on Mars. The route cannot be changed after confirmation.


Following a tracer, Spike enters the rotating part of the ship.

SPIKE: Ed! You aren't here, are you? Hey!

Spike finds Ed's heat sensor on the floor.

SPIKE: Did that thing get her too...?


Spike enters a dark corridor. Oil drips from a pipe above, startling him.

SPIKE: Don't surprise me!

Spike stops to light a cigarette. The blob slithers past Spike.

SPIKE: I've been waiting for ya!

Spike fires a net at the creature. It slips through. The creature advances
at Spike, making him fall and break his spectacles. He gets up.

SPIKE: Excellent!

He tosses gas cans, slips out of the room and seals it. He sits down,
cigarette still in mouth. He reaches into his coat and pockets for his
lighter but could not find it. He blasts the cigarette with the
flamethrower, burning it completely. He gives up. Spike returns into the
gas-filled room then leaps back out, blob behind him. He fires his gun at
it.

SPIKE: Come on, you slime!

The blob charges at him. He leaps over it and continues to fire. He makes a
connecting shot, striking it dead center.

SPIKE: Got 'im!

Spike fries the blob with the flamethrower. He approaches it, smelling the
fumes coming off of it.

SPIKE: This thing seems familiar...

Spike remembers the kabobs.

SPIKE: I guess I shoulda eaten that... Oh yeah, it should be in the
fridge...

Spike suddenly remembers something he should not have forgotten.


The stock room. Spike narrates.

SPIKE: That was when I remembered everything. It was... oh, one year ago.
When I had gotten a hold of a real lobster I hid it in the fridge in
this stock room just so nobody else would eat it. But I had
forgotten about it, and left it in there for a whole year, I wonder
what it looks like in there now...

Spike opens the fridge and sees a disgusting mess. He slams the fridge.


Spike disables the gravity of the ship and pushes the refrigerator out of
the stock room and into the corridor leading to the hatch. The blob leaps
from the refrigerator and bites Spike on the wrist.

SPIKE: Shit...!

The creature slithers away.

SPIKE: Dammit...!

The refrigerator bounces off of the closed hatch. The door begins to creak
open. Spike opens the hatch and pushes the refrigerator out into space. As
he closes the hatch, he passes out. Spike narrates.

SPIKE: You shouldn't leave things in the fridge. That is the lesson.


Somewhere on the Bebop. Ed sleeps. The creature floats by. Ed grabs it.

ED: Sweet bean roll!

Ed tosses the blob into her mouth, chews and swallows.

ED: Mmm... can't eat anymore...


THE END


COMING EPISODE

ED: And so, they all passed away. Everyone, it was brief, but thanks for
your support. This was the last episode. I hope they rest in peace.
Amen. And starting next episode, we bring you "Cowgirl Ed!" I'm the
main character!

SPIKE: Hey, wait a minute!

FAYE: What kinda selfish crap is that?!

JET: Next episode: "Jupiter Jazz (Part 1)"

SPIKE: There really is another episode!

Jupiter Jazz (Part 1)

OPENING CREDITS


Somewhere. Sometime. Laughing Bull and a child sit by a tent. The two spot
a shooting star.

CHILD: The star fell, Bull.

BULL: That is no ordinary star. That is the tear of a warrior.

CHILD: What is a warrior?

BULL: One who has finished his battle somewhere on this planet... A pitiful
soul that could not believe in the Great Spirit...


Space. Aboard a Red Dragon Syndicate cruiser. A young man named Lin,
Vicious, and three elders, leaders of the syndicate, Wang Long, Ping
Long and Sou Long discuss a potential drug deal.

LIN: The report from Callisto went directly to Sir Vicious. He is
requesting a deal for Red-Eye. 30,000 Woolongs per gram. A total of
7500 grams.

WANG LONG: Why did he specify you as the dealer?

VICIOUS: He is a Titan veteran. We were in the same unit.

SOU LONG: Why does he rely on you now?

VICIOUS: Callisto is undergoing a depression right now. If he can't see the
future, he is sure to worry.

PING LONG: All the more reason to keep our hands out of that moon.

SOU LONG: Vicious, are you not the one that is worrying?

PING LONG: You have no permission to make your own decisions.

SOU LONG: Regardless of who it is, those who go against the Van's will are
punished.

VICIOUS: You believe that I would betray my own mentor?

PING LONG: Mao's case was merely bad luck.

WANG LONG: Lin... You shall go with Vicious.

LIN: Yes.

PING LONG & SOU LONG: Wang Long!

WANG LONG: Callisto is a frigid planet. Take plenty of winter clothes.

VICIOUS: To me, no cold climate is worth taking precautions for.

WANG LONG: It is true that the planet is warmer than your heart. Your heart
is colder than a snake's skin.

Vicious stands from his seat and begins to exit.

WANG LONG: Vicious.

Vicious stops.

WANG LONG: A snake cannot eat a dragon.


The rotating part of the ship.

VICIOUS: I will be fine by myself.

LIN: I'll go with you.

VICIOUS: Remember this. If you want to survive, you must betray me at
times.

LIN: No, never. That would go against the Van's will.

VICIOUS: Such old-fashioned thinking makes me nauseous. Those damn corpses!

LIN: I will protect you, for the honor of the Red Dragon.

VICIOUS: Honor, huh...? Then, it's up to me to slaughter them all!


Session #12
JUPITER JAZZ (PART I)


The Bebop. Spike wakes from a nap on the couch.

SPIKE: It's hot...

He spots Ed on her computer.

SPIKE: Where are the others?

Ed gestures with her head.

SPIKE: What a depressing bunch...


The control room. Jet, among floating nuts and bolts, examines the ship.

SPIKE: What's with this humidity? It's so muggy that I can't sleep!

Jet tosses Spike a note.

JET: Oh, it's just a breakdown.

Spike catches it and reads.

SPIKE: "It'd be hard for me to do if I saw your faces so I'm leaving
without seeing you one last time. PLEASE don't look for me." That
wench...

JET: She sucked out all the antifreeze from the radiator. It'll be out for
at least half a day.

SPIKE: Even if she didn't pull this stunt we wouldn't look for her. Right?

Jet smiles.

JET: She emptied out the safe as well.


Spike and Jet approach Ed to look for Faye on the internet.

ED: 7, 8, 9... hello!

SPIKE: Are you really looking for Faye?

ED: 1, 0, 1, 1, good-bye!

SPIKE: Are you just wasting time?

JET: Is there anything else to do right now?

ED: Ooh! Boom!

SPIKE: You found her?!

ED: I wonder who this is... Lesse... code name... Julia!

The name catches Spike's attention.

SPIKE: Where is that coming from?!

ED: Lesse... Pretty close... Looks like Blue Crow on Callisto...

SPIKE: Where's it going to?

ED: It got disconnected...

Spike runs off.

JET: Hey!

ED: But... Actually, there are no girls in Blue Crow. Honestly...

JET: Hey, Spike...

Jet runs off.

ED: Is that it?


The rotating part of the ship. Jet chases after Spike.

JET: Hey! Hey, wait, Spike! That's a common woman's name! What about Faye?

SPIKE: Leave her.

JET: This is a lawless area. A woman surely can't survive wandering about
all alone!

SPIKE: Feeling sympathetic?

JET: Plenty of sympathy... for the money she ran away with!

JET: Spike!

Spike enters the hanger. Jet follows.

SPIKE: I'm gonna go look.

JET: What?

SPIKE: I'm gonna look for my woman. You can look for that other woman.

JET: You're gonna have nothing to do with this? That's right. We only go so
far. Even if you come back, there won't be a place for you here.

SPIKE: Can't do anything about it. I'm sure you're not as lonely now that
you have more strange roommates.

JET: Me? You stayed here just for that reason? You're being stupid! It's
been three years since I teamed up with you. But I never knew you
looked at me that way! I was under the impression that YOU were the
lonely one!

SPIKE: Well we got rid of that misunderstanding.

Spike boards Swordfish II.

JET: Good riddance! Now we'll have more money for food! I never did
understand you, even to the very end!

SPIKE: I don't understand, either.

JET: So long!

Swordfish II takes off for Calisto.


Faye sits in a shady bar called Rester House. A saxophone player named Gren
plays a solemn tune.


A junkyard. A man smashes monitors with a large mallet.

MAN: I don't know any woman. Like I would know!

SPIKE: Not even a rumor?

MAN: I have no luck with 'em! I'd rather be with an armadillo!

SPIKE: Have you heard of the name Julia?

MAN: You should a said so earlier! There's one in front of Tony's place
every night!


On the street. Spike approaches a blonde drag queen.

JULIUS: Excuse me! I'm not Julia. Ju-li-US! I'm Julius!

SPIKE: Oh, I see...

JULIUS: Hey, you're my type. Wanna hang out with me tonight?

SPIKE: I'm sorry, I already have plans.

JULIUS: Oh, yeah. Gren might know something... I've seen him with a woman
before.

SPIKE: Gren?

DRAG QUEEN A: It's cold.

DRAG QUEEN B: Looks like this is it for tonight.

DRAG QUEEN A: Oh, a customer?

JULIUS: Not even. Can't you tell he's straight? Come on, let's switch
locations.

SPIKE: Hey, who and where is Gren?

JULIUS: So you wanna hang out with me tonight? He's a sax player in Blue
Crow.


Rester House. Faye sneezes. Gren approaches her.

GREN: Take care.

Faye turns and sees him

GREN: That was close. When someone sneezes and doesn't get told to take
care, that person becomes a fairy. That's what they say around here.

Faye smiles.

FAYE: Then it's okay. I'm already a fairy.

Gren puts his coat over her shoulders.

FAYE: I'm not as easy as I appear to be.

GREN: Unfortunately, I am not interested in women...

FAYE: Oh, that's a shame...

GREN: But the others seem to be highly interested. You didn't know that
there were no women in this town?

FAYE: So I'll be very popular...

GREN: You should watch out...

Faye tosses Gren's coat back to him.

FAYE: Thanks for the warning.

She exits.


EYECATCH


Spike walks down a dark alley and finds a suspicious man.

SPIKE: I'm searching for something...

MAN: There's nothing here. The only things are stale bread, a broken-down
car, and rancid booze.

SPIKE: I'm looking for a guy named Gren.

MAN: No idea.

SPIKE: I see.

Spike continues on his way. The suspicious man and several men in oxygen
masks follow Spike. Spike runs into a dead-end.

SPIKE: Hey, you need something?

MAN: You're Vicious, right?

SPIKE: ME?!

MAN: Where's the money?

MASKED MAN IN FRONT: If ya don't put out, it won't do ya any good!

Spike is infuriated.

SPIKE: This is annoying... So annoying it's repulsive!

Spike beats the living daylights out of the lot of them. He puts the
suspicious man in a head lock.

SPIKE: What the hell do you mean?! Why the hell am I Vicious?

MAN: There was info that there was gonna be some deal for Red-Eye. From
Gren to Vicious. I thought of taking that cash...

Spike tosses him.

SPIKE: You think I look like I got money?

MAN: Foreigners are all rich.

SPIKE: And the code name was Julia?

MAN: Heh... Sure sounds like some easy wench's name!

SPIKE: Yeah... really.

Spike knocks him out.


A shady bar. Jet enters. Big Shot is on a monitor.

JET: Gimme a Cowboy.

BARTENDER: There are no bounties around here.

JET: Bourbon with milk.

BARTENDER: Oh, THAT Cowboy. I knew that. You can't possibly be a bounty
hunter.

Jet watches the show.

JUDY: So, who's our customer today? Grencia Mars Eliijah Guo Eckener.
That's a long name!

PUNCH: Yeah. He escaped from military prison three years ago and the
statute of limitations is about to expire.

JUDY: And that means?

PUNCH: The bounty is double!

JUDY: This is a chance you can't miss! But I kinda feel like we can let him
go...

PUNCH: Judy, what are you saying? He's an escaped convict!

JUDY: But, Punch... He's very handsome! Just look at his picture!

PUNCH: Lesse... Oh, come on... I'm much more handsome than he is...

Jet takes out his communicator forgetting he is ignoring Spike. He
remembers and put it back into his coat.

JUDY: Punch, I just can't laugh at that joke...

JET: Hey, can you turn that thing off?!

BARTENDER: Well, calm down. I'm sorry, man.

The bartender turns off the monitor.

BARTENDER: Don't worry.

He points to an unconscious man in sitting to the side.

BARTENDER: That guy passed out over there is a cop.

JET: What do ya wanna say?

BARTENDER: Actually, there's a bounty on my head, too. This place is a
hideout for people like that.

JET: I see...

BARTENDER: So you can rest assured.

JET: Me?

The bartender gives Jet a thumbs up. Jet sighs.


Faye walks down an empty dark alley.

FAYE: What's with this? I wanted to get rid of all this frustration, and
nobody's coming?

She turns around and spots the group Spike beat up earlier.

FAYE: Oh... you're all here.

MAN: Miss, your appearance is rather harmful to the eyes. Or are you
enticing us?

FAYE: Yeah, I am... Hold on a minute.

She puts on leather gloves.

FAYE: If I don't do this, I'll chip a nail... Okay, any time now!

A masked man charges at her.

MASKED MAN: You wench...!

She dodges and kicks him in the back. The suspicious man charges at her.
Gren, out of nowhere, smashes the man's face against his saxophone case.

GREN: Hurry!

Gren takes Faye's hand and they run.


Gren's apartment.

FAYE: Why did you bring me here?

GREN: Because you said you're a fairy. Why did you come with me?

FAYE: 'Coz I got no place to stay.

GREN: You can trust me that easily?

FAYE: You said you weren't interested in women.

GREN: I might take your money and kill you...

FAYE: That's fine. I've lived longer than I seem.

Faye picks up a small music box and winds it. Gren grabs it out of her
hand.

GREN: It's broken. You came to such a slummy neighborhood all by yourself?

FAYE: I'm alone. I don't want comrades and it's not worth having any... I
end up worrying about things I don't have to... You know, 'coz I'm
such a good woman... All the guys end up fighting for me. They often
say that humans can't live alone... But you can live pretty long by
yourself. Instead of feeling alone in a group it's better to be alone
in your solitude. When I'm dealing with them, it's nothing but
trouble and I don't get squat out of it... So it doesn't matter if
I'm there or not...

GREN: You just got scared of losing them. So you distanced yourself from
them.

FAYE: You're weird.

GREN: Think so?

FAYE: I don't know why I'm talking to you about this... I feel like I'm in
a confessional... Have you ever had experience as a minister?

GREN: No...

They look into eachother's eyes. Suddenly Faye sneezes.


GREN: Take care. You want to take a shower?

FAYE: No, thanks. I don't know where peeping toms might be...

GREN: You shouldn't peek, either.

FAYE: Hm, I can't guarantee that.


Faye looks at photographs on Gren's wall. He sees a familiar face.
Suddenly the phone rings. The answering machine picks up the call.

VICIOUS: Gren... You're not there?

FAYE: Vicious?!

VICIOUS: I'm out with "honroutou." Along with the "mangan" and the
"ura-dora," it's 32,000. I'll be waiting.


A snowy vacant lot. Spike approaches Vicious and Lin.

SPIKE: Are you dating Julia behind my back?

LIN: Sir Spike!

SPIKE: Hey, Lin. You've gotten pretty big.

VICIOUS: He used to work under you, but things are different now.

SPIKE: I feel sorry for her. Having her name used for some crooked deal
like this.

VICIOUS: You were always the one leaving others out of the loop.

Vicious grasps the handle of his katana.

SPIKE: We still haven't settled the score from earlier.

Spike points his gun at him.

VICIOUS: Anytime.

Lin stands guard in front of Vicious.

SPIKE: Lin!


Gren's apartment. Armed, Faye goes into the bathroom where Gren showers.
She pulls away the shower curtain.


The vacant lot.

SPIKE: Get out of the way, Lin!

VICIOUS: Julia was here, in this town.

SPIKE: Hey, out of the way, Lin!

Lin points his gun at Spike.

SPIKE: Lin...


Gren's apartment. Shocked, Faye sees a pair of breasts on Gren.

FAYE: A woman?

Even more shocked, she peers down to see a set of male genitalia.

FAYE: W-Which are you?

He corners Faye.

GREN: I am both, but I am neither.


The vacant lot. Lin shoots Spike. Vicious and Lin leave. Spike lies
unconscious in the snow.

SPIKE: Hey... How are men and women different?

FAYE: Hmm... I think women are hiding more vital things than men are.

SPIKE: Yeah... but there are women that aren't feminine.

FAYE: And there are men that aren't masculine.

SPIKE: What about those that aren't normally feminine but show that side on
some chance circumstance? I like that.

FAYE: Oh?

SPIKE: I'm not talking about you.

Session #13
JUPITER JAZZ (PART II)


Spike is unconscious in the snow.


Gren's apartment. The living room.

GREN: I was in the same unit as Vicious on Titan. You said that you didn't
need comrades... but I'm attracted to that word... to the point of
tears... On Titan, we were all comrades...


Gren remineces the past. Titan. A constant sand storm. Gun and canon fire.
Mines. A skeleton with a rifle.


Gren lies back in a trench. He hears a music box to his side. In that
direction, he sees Vicious. He approaches Vicious.

GREN: What song is that?

VICIOUS: Julia...

GREN: That's a good tune. Would you mind if I played that tune on my sax
when I go home after all this?

Vicious gives him the music box. Vicious gets up. Suddenly, he turns around
and thrusts a combat knife next to Gren's head. Gren looks to his side. A
scorpion is split in two. Vicious walks away.


Gren's apartment.

GREN: After I came home from the war, I was imprisoned. They suspected that
I was a spy. I heard that Vicious testified against me. In prison, I
went insane from insomnia. As a result, I became a drug addict. There
were side effects... My hormonal balance went out of whack, and this 
is what happened. You're the second person to know Vicious since I
arrived here. And the second that I've talked about this to...

FAYE: Why are you going to see Vicious? Didn't you just say that he framed
you?

GREN: I want to see if he really did.

FAYE: You're going to die.

GREN: I'm not afraid to die.

FAYE: You're lying.

GREN: Either way, I won't last much longer.

FAYE: Why did you bring me here?

GREN: Perhaps I wanted to be with someone...

FAYE: You selfishly help people, and bring them along and then you go off
to die?

Faye fires at Gren. Gren dodges and binds her.


Rester House. Jet talks to the bartender, presenting a photograph of Faye.
All stools are up on the counter except for the corner bar stool.

JET: Are you sure it was this woman?

BARTENDER: Yeah... It's been six months since I last saw a woman in the
flesh... and two years since I saw someone that good-looking. Of
course I wouldn't make a mistake!

JET: I never wanna live in this town...

BARTENDER: She sat there, and was talking to Gren. Julia always sat in that
seat, too.

JET: Julia?

BARTENDER: She suddenly wandered in two years ago, and disappeared before a
month passed.

JET: What kinda woman was she?

BARTENDER: She was a real babe.


Memories, visions and voices.

VICIOUS: I'm the only one that can keep you alive... And I'm the only one
that can kill you...

SPIKE: I'm only watching a dream that I never awakened from.

JULIA: It's like I am watching a dream...

VICIOUS: Be careful when you're with that woman.

JULIA: Women are all liars...

SPIKE: When this is over, I'm getting out of all this. And then... will you
come with me?

VICIOUS: Are you going to betray me?

JULIA: They're going to kill you...

FAYE: Oh, you're finally up. You've slept too much. It's been three days.

JULIA: Your left eye and right eye are different colors...

SPIKE: My left eye sees the past...

JULIA: Then what about your right eye?


Spike regains consciousness. A crow stands on his chest.

SPIKE: I'm not dead... Which way is west?

The crow flies away.

SPIKE: Thanks.

He feels his wound.

SPIKE: Tranquilizer, huh? They're mocking me...


A dark alley. Jet finds the suspicious man Spike and Faye met earlier.

JET: Sorry, but can I ask ya something? Where is a blue apartment building
called Orlando?

MAN: Don't ask me! I don't know anything!

JET: Um, come on...

MAN: I want nothing to do with foreigners from now on...

JET: I'm just asking!

MAN: I'm gonna go find an honest job...

The man tosses himself into a garbage truck.

JET: What the hell?

Jet turns his head and sees the building.

JET: It's HERE...


Gren's apartment. Jet enters a room and sees Faye lying on a bed.

JET: Hey! Hey, get it together!

FAYE: Jet?

JET: What the hell are you doing? What's all this about?

He turns her and sees handcuffs. 

JET: He was one of THOSE kinds of guys?

FAYE: What are you saying? Gren... isn't like that.

JET: Gren?


Spike flies in Swordfish, searching for Vicious.

SPIKE: "Mangan" with "ura-dora"... He's using an ancient code...

He thinks.

VICIOUS: Julia was here... in this town.

Spike receives a call from Jet.

JET: Yo.

SPIKE: Yeah?

JET: Got anything?

SPIKE: None.

JET: I got something good.

SPIKE: Catch 'em yourself.

JET: I know about the guy from that code name "Julia". It's a guy named
Gren. He's an escaped convict, and has a hefty bounty on his head. If
you catch him, I'll let you back on.

Jet disconnects.


Gren calls Vicious.

VICIOUS: Hello? I'm overhead. 

GREN: Come to the roof of the building closest to the sky. I'll send a
woman over.

VICIOUS: I don't care... Although I would have liked to see you as well...


Jet flies Hammerhead with Faye in Red Tail attached to the bottom.

JET: You broke the Bebop, but kept the Swordfish and Hammerhead mobile. Did
you leave that message so that we'd come find you?

FAYE: You've got to be kidding.

JET: Were you just testing us?

FAYE: Why did you come here?

JET: I want my money back.

FAYE: The safe only had 20,000 in it.

JET: Is that so?

FAYE: Dummy. Hey... Who is Julia?

JET: Dunno... but she has something to do with Spike. That's all I know.


EYECATCH


The Bebop. Ed lures Ein to her with a trail of food items.

ED: Souvenir, souvenir, is it here yet?


Atop a building. Gren, in women's clothing, stands several yards away from
Vicious and Lin. He puts down a bag full of viles of Red-Eye. Lin
approaches Gren and examines a vile with spectrum device.

LIN: It has an EX+ ranking. It's real.

VICIOUS: Hand it over.

Lin puts down a suitcase in front of Gren.

LIN: This is the Titan Opal that you requested.

VICIOUS: Give Gren my regards.

Vicious walks away.

GREN: You saved me from that scorpion back then... Yet you sold me out...

Vicious stops. Gren slides the suitcase over to Vicious. He shoots at it
until it opens, revealing an explosive device. The case detonates.


From a distance, Spike is alerted to the explosion and boards Swordfish.


Atop the building. Lin is hurt from the explosion. Gren points his gun at
Vicious.

VICIOUS: Gren?

GREN: Long time no see.

VICIOUS: What are you up to?

GREN: You gave me that music box because you never thought I'd take it
apart and examine it?

VICIOUS: You found the transmitter...

GREN: Julia was the one who found it. She realized as soon as she heard it
was a gift from you.

VICIOUS: And what about it?

GREN: Are you trying to kill me again? We fought in the war together... We
were comrades... We fought together... on that desert battlefield...
I looked up to you... I believed in you...

VICIOUS: There is nothing there to believe. Nor is there a need to
believe...

Gren fires at Vicious. Vicious dodges the bullets. Lin runs in to protect
Vicious.

LIN: Sir Vicious!

Lin is shot dead. From above, Spike witnesses Lin's death in Swordfish.

VICIOUS: In this world there is nothing to believe in...

Vicious tosses the bag into his fighter. Vicious and Gren board their
fighters. Spike fires at Vicious.

SPIKE: Vicious! Lin's soul won't be saved since he lost his life protecting
someone like you!

VICIOUS: I'm not what he was protecting! He protected the rules!

Vicious fires at Spike. Spike dodges. Gren fires at Vicious. Vicious
targets Gren.

VICIOUS: You're in the way!

Vicious fires two missiles at Gren. One of them hits the engine. Gren
coughs violently. Spike destroys the other missile. Gren's ship steadily
loses altitude. Vicious fires two missiles at Spike. Spike maneuvers one
into a building and destroys the other one with the laser canon. Vicious
continues to fire at Spike. Suddenly, Vicious hears the music box from
inside the bag of Red-Eye. The music box explodes, destroying his right
wing. He escapes onto a Red Dragon cruiser.


Spike lands Swordfish next to Gren's crashed fighter. He finds Gren, lying
in the snow.

SPIKE: Hey! Come on, get a grip! Hey! Where is Julia? Where did she go?!

GREN: Do you know her?

SPIKE: Where is she now?

Gren coughs blood.

SPIKE: He hit some vital organs.

Spike takes out his communicator and begins to dial.

SPIKE: Shit, would an ambulance come to a place like this?

Gren pushes the communicator away.

GREN: Can you lift me up into the pod again? I want to go to Titan...

SPIKE: You can't possibly last in your condition! It would take too long!

GREN: I won't last long anyway... Dying during the voyage would be a good
way to go... I want to return there... one more time. I want to be as
close as I can... Please...

Spike puts Gren in his fighter.

GREN: I see. You are Spike. Julia was always talking about you... That your
two eyes were of different colors... That's what she said... That you
get a strange feeling when you look into his eyes...

SPIKE: What was she doing?

GREN: In the corner seat of the bar... She always sat there while I wasn't
paying attention... She always requested the same song... and smiled.
Sadly... smiled.


Spike launches Gren's fighter on a course to Titan.


Spike fies back to the Bebop.

JET: What do you have?

SPIKE: Nothing.

JET: Hurry up and get in. We're taking off.


The Bebop living room. Ed paints Faye's toenails all different colors.

FAYE: Julia...

ED: What?

FAYE: Mm... nothing. Just an adult's idle muttering.

ED: Where did all of you guys go?

FAYE: Someplace good.

ED: Ed's the only one left out!

FAYE: I'll tell you someday.

ED: Nah, it's okay, really.

Ed paints her right big toenail blue.

FAYE: You're not being cute.


Somewhere. Sometime. Laughing Bull and a child sit by a tent. The two spot
a shooting star.

CHILD: The star fell, Bull.

BULL: That is no ordinary star. That is the tear of a warrior.

CHILD: What is a warrior?

BULL: One who has finished his battle somewhere on this planet. A pitiful
soul that could not believe in the Great Spirit...

On the street, Spike punches out a man.

On a train, Faye tranquilizes a man with a concealed device.

At the top of an escalator, Jet fires a net at several men.

Somewhere, a chess piece is moved.


The Bebop. Spike, Jet and Faye return to Ed and Ein.

ED: Welcome back... and how was it?

They all speak at once.

FAYE: Oh, they were just thugs! They went to the cops penniless!
JET: Dammit, was just a salaried employee that gave into his temptations.
SPIKE: Nothing to do with the syndicate. They just wanted money to play
with.

ED: Then what? All of you caught the criminals, but no clue about the
bounty we're really after?

Spike, Jet and Faye reach into their pockets, each drawing a king chess
piece.


Session #14
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY


Gate Corporation Headquarters. The desk of the Head Executive is surrounded
by tall stacks of paper.

EXECUTIVE: They still use paper just for all the complaints. Dammit,
they're just harassing us. AND, it's a waste of valuable
resources!

ASSISTANT: The e-mail server is going down from the sheer number of
complaints. There is a movement out there to sue our company for
damages...

EXECUTIVE: What the hell are the bounty hunters doing?! We already have a
huge bounty on him!

ASSISTANT: Yes, however...


The Bebop. Big Shot on the monitor

PUNCH: AMIGO! All you bounty hunters in the Sol Solar System, how are y'all
doing?

JUDY: Once again, it's time for BIG SHOT!

PUNCH: We'll start with today's hot news! They apprehended the culprit in
the series of recent Gate assaults!

JUDY: Really? The bounty on him was 12 million Woolongs, right?

PUNCH: But the weird thing is that 20 culprits were apprehended!

JUDY: What do you mean?

PUNCH: Apparently, they were all caught in the act, but none were the
mastermind.

JUDY: Then you don't get the reward unless you find that mastermind?

PUNCH: But of course!

JUDY: Oh, my... I feel sorry for all the guys who caught the culprits!

Spike kicks off the monitor.

JET: Why the hell do these thugs that normally just rob convenience stores
attack at the Gates?

SPIKE: Maybe there are fads in crimes?

FAYE: Like "Hyperspace Gates are the IN thing among today's
fashion-conscious kids! That girl won't even look your way until
you assault at least one Gate!" or something?

The ceiling fan suddenly shorts out.

FAYE: Hey, guys. Why don't we trade the information that we each have and
split the bounty three ways?

SPIKE: What do you mean? You're the one that started all this, saying that
we should research this case on our own.

JET: You also said that the occasional rivalry between comrades would be
good for us.

SPIKE: Come on, did the reward amount make you lose your memory?

FAYE: What? You guys were really keen on the idea too! After all, we all
wanted the bounty to ourselves, right?


Somewhere, an old man sits at a chess board.


The Bebop living room.

JET: In this case, all 20 cases were done the same way. All of them
infiltrated the tollbooth deftly attached the hacking unit and in the
exact moment that passing ships access the tollbooth to pay the toll
they steal the entire balance from the credit card. Furthermore, the
unit automatically sent the money data that it just stole. It
immediately launders all the funds in a bank on Europa making it
impossible to track where it went. All the culprits that were caught
in the act have nothing in common. Age, gender, nationality, religion,
criminal record. And on top of it, nobody has any of the money that
they supposedly stole. Well, that's about all I know. How about you?

FAYE: The guy that I nabbed said that he was just following the
instructions from a manual that he got through mail-order. Perhaps
the other culprits are reading the same manual that he was?

JET: Manual?

Faye pulls an old warn out flyer from her coat pocket.

FAYE: This.

She hands it to Jet. Jet reads it.

JET: "A new criminal support software. Right now, it's a real bargain. For
the low introductory price of 30 thousand Woolongs, you too can be
rich!" What the hell?

FAYE: It's not easy to be a thief nowadays. I'm sure there are people who
want manuals to help them.

JET: And where is this mail-order company?

FAYE: It's a store that's only on the net, so I don't know where it was.
Besides, the store has already closed.

JET: Spike, how about you?

SPIKE: The hacking unit that was placed on the Gates was something that
couldn't be made unless you knew about the Gate system really well.
The mastermind's likely someone who has some connection to the
Gate Corporation. That was my hunch, and I investigated that front-

Ed suddenly crawls by with an internet chess board.

JET: The programmers would be fishy.

SPIKE: But the guys from the Gate Corporation suddenly became
uncooperative. It was as if they knew something, but didn't want us
to find out about it.

Ed lifts a panel from the side of the wall. She tries to plug the board in
and electrically shocks herself unconscious. 

FAYE: Are you dead?

Faye pokes Ed. Ed pops back up and proceeds to set the board up.

SPIKE: Where were we?

Jet pulls out a chess piece.

JET: Well, I guess those are the only clues we have for now...

ED: Gimme that. Gimme.

JET: Yeah.

Jet tosses Ed the chess piece.

ED: This is a memory cartridge for playing chess over the net. This piece
has one match in its memory. And, when you push it, it connects to the
net.

Ed connects.

ED: See?

FAYE: And this has something to do with this incident?

ED: Nothing at all.

JET: Maybe all of this is a game. For now, continue playing that game with
the opponent.

ED: Yup.

JET: I'll go talk to the Gate Corporation guys once more.

ED: Lesse. Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

Ed makes a move.

ED: Play ball!


Somewhere. A dark room. The old man connects to Ed's game.


Gate Corporation Headquarters.

EXECUTIVE: Another bounty hunter? I don't care, send him back.

ASSISTANT: But he's asking about a chess-loving programmer...

EXECUTIVE: What?!


An elevator opens. Jet sees the bounty hunter Jonathan, a familiar
colleague.

JONATHAN: Jet!

JET: What, Jonathan, were you another one that went through all the trouble
to get nothing?

JONATHAN: This thing isn't that easy.

Jonathan exits.


The office of the Head Executive.

EXECUTIVE: I believe we have given out all the information. What more are
you saying you would like to know?

Jet lights a cigarette.

EXECUTIVE: Sorry, but there is no smoking allowed in this building.

JET: Oops. I'm so sorry. Actually I had something that I wanted you to see.

Jet puts the butt into the pot of a plant.

EXECUTIVE: What is it?

Jet tosses him a chess piece.

JET: This is a planned game. You guys at the Gate Corporation should know
what this means. I mean, to put a bounty on a mastermind that we
aren't even sure exists suggests that its someone you don't want the
police to know about, no?

EXECUTIVE: Bounty hunters should just look for their bounties. I don't know
who you are, and whether or not you used to work for the ISSP,
but it's better for you to not make any extra inquiries.

The turns his back and orders his assistant.

EXECUTIVE: He's going home. Make sure he is kindly escorted out of here.


The garage. Jet pushes tunes his communicator.

JET: Damn this old piece of shit...!

He listens in on a conversation going on in the Head Executive's office.
The cigarette butt he left in the plant is a bug.

ASSISTANT: I believe our risk is too great. If that gets out to the general
public -

EXECUTIVE: I am fully aware of our risk. If we don't catch him, the
situation will just get worse.

ASSISTANT: But why is a ghost from 50 years ago coming back now?

EXECUTIVE: To think that he gave everyone a chess piece... Chessmaster
Hex...

ASSISTANT: So it IS a game that he setup...

Jonathan spies from a dark corner.

JET: Chessmaster Hex...


Somewhere. In the dark room, Hex continues his chess game with Ed with
pleasure.


EYECATCH


The Bebop living room. Ed continues her game with Hex. Spike analyzes one
of the chess pieces with the computer.

SPIKE: No good. This doesn't have anything other than chess data in it.

FAYE: I wonder what they were going to do with such a thing.

SPIKE: If there is no meaning to the content, maybe the pieces are the
message.

Ed claps her feet.

ED: Great, great!

Jet calls them.

JET: Spike, I have a name. Can you investigate the guy? He might be the
mastermind behind this whole thing.

SPIKE: Hey, Ed.

ED: Ed's really busy right now.


Somewhere. The dark room. Hex makes another move.


The Bebop living room. Ed flails her arms in the air. She makes a move.

ED: Here, here! Checkmate!


The dark room. Hex is startled.


The Bebop.

ED: Or so you thought!

Ed makes an unpredictable move.

ED: I'll fork the king and the rook!


The dark room. Hex laughs heartily.

HEX: Indeed! This is either an idiot or a genius! I like this chap!


The Bebop. Spike finds information on Hex.

SPIKE: Chessmaster Hex. Estimated to be 98 years old. A programmer that had
been dubbed a genius from his teens. In the Cosmo-net chess
tournaments, he dominated the champion's seat for decades. He began
work on the Hyperspace Gate control program when he was 30 and
created the central control system that all Gates use to this day.
However, that was his fatal error. He started to doubt the safety of
the Gates he helped create and was against putting them to practical
use. As a result, he was banned from the Gate Corporation. Ever
since, his whereabouts have been unknown for 50 years.


Jet on Hammerhead in space.

JET: So he's the mastermind behind our current string of crimes.


The Bebop.

FAYE: What do you mean? I mean, why is he seeking revenge 50 years after
the fact?

SPIKE: If we figure out where he is, we'll know for sure. Hey, Ed.

ED: Ed's really busy right now.

FAYE: Hey, you, quit playing games so much and help out a little.

Faye reaches for the chessboard. Ed grabs it, turns to Faye and growls.

SPIKE: Ed, we want to figure out where a guy named Hex is.

ED: Hex... Hex... The Chessmaster?! That's who I'm playing chess against
right now!


The Bebop takes off. Jonathan follows in his ship.


The Bebop control room.

JET: We're almost at the location we got from the trace we did on Ed's
chess opponent. You guys standing by?

Spike in space suit in Swordfish II.

SPIKE: I really don't like this. I mean, he's basically giving us his
exact location.

Faye in space suit above Spike in Red Tail.

FAYE: Can we even trust that trace in the first place? Ya think he'd be in
a dump like this?

Jet in the control room.

JET: No, I think it was... that. I had heard once that there was a place
where all the scrapped remains of obsolete Gates were gathered along
with scrap metal and abandoned space ships and that there were people
that started living there.

FAYE: Why the hell do they want to live here of all places?

JET: That area has no nationality, nor a government. You don't have to pay
taxes, and there are no cops.

SPIKE: I see... It's the perfect place to hide yourself.

Swordfish II and Red Tail take off into the floating junk heap.

JET: It might be a trap. This might be the continuation of the game.

SPIKE: Whatever happens, happens.


Spike and Faye land and enter the floating heap.

FAYE: Looks like we have air.

JET: Then there is someone here...


The Bebop control room. Jonathan calls Jet.

JONATHAN: Yo, Jet.

JET: Jonathan! How the hell did you get here?

JONATHAN: Thanks for leading the way!

JET: You were following us the whole time?

JONATHAN: Tough luck for you, but I have important business with that guy.
So I'll be going ahead.

Jonathan fires his laser canon at the Bebop and takes off.


The junk heap. Spike finds a cat floating along.

SPIKE: What the...

Faye spots tomatoes growing from the ceiling.

FAYE: What?

Spike comes across more house pets.

SPIKE: How the hell...

Faye spots a cache of homeless men.

FAYE: What is this?

Spike finds a flock of pigeons.

SPIKE: What is this?


Faye enters a smokey room and spots two hippies.

HIPPY A: Hi! Peace to the world and love to my bank account!

A hippy offers Faye a joint.

HIPPY B: You want one?


The Bebop. The chess game between Hex and Ed continues.

ED: Wow! Amazing!


Hex's room. Hex laughs. Suddenly two doors are kicked in. It is Spike and
Faye. They point their guns at Hex.

SPIKE: Chessmaster Hex?

FAYE: All right, give up!

HEX: You guys, can you be a little quieter?

Spike and Faye are confused. Jonathan suddenly appears.

JONATHAN: Old man! Don't joke with me!

He points a large gun at Hex.

SPIKE: Hey, wait a minute.

JONATHAN: You won't get away with pretending to be senile!

FAYE: Who are YOU?

JONATHAN: If you don't hand over the money you stole you'll get a nice hole
in your brain!

Hex pushes aside the barrel of the gun.

HEX: That's a big tube you got there...

Old Man Antonio suddenly enters.

ANTONIO: Hey, whatcha doin', Hex?

HEX: You gotta hear this. It's my first formidable opponent in quite a
while!

Old Man Carlos enters.

CARLOS: Must be some player if you have trouble winning!

Old Man Jobin enters.

HEX: But before that, where's lunch?

ANTONIO: What are ya saying? You just ate lunch a while back!

HEX: Oh, is that so?

ANTONIO: Really, you've lost so much of yer mind that all you can do is
play chess!

Spike and Faye step asside.

FAYE: Who are these guys?

SPIKE: Dunno. But you know, this old fogey...

JOBIN: Have ya lost it?

ANTONIO: Like you can speak... You...

Jonathan breaks down.

JONATHAN: To... To think my life savings are never coming back... Damn...
Goddammit... Anyone and everyone, you and that guy over there...
The world is all a mistake!

He starts firing his gun in random directions. Spike kicks him in the face
and he crashes into a pile of junk. Faye takes his gun.

FAYE: What are we gonna do? This old man doesn't seem to remember anything
about yesterday, let alone 50 years ago!

SPIKE: That's right. Hex is no longer here. Here we merely have an old man
that loves games.


Gate Corporation Headquarters.

JET: Back then, Hex was riled up for revenge, and planned this all out. He
made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later...during the
one moment that the Gate program gets automatically updated. Even
making those that physically commit the crime hold chess pieces to
hint that it was his doing. However, to that old-timer, 50 years was
too long. He went senile and had completely forgotten about the traps
that he himself had set. Well, it works out better for you this way.
Because now you don't have to worry about the fundamental defect in
the Gates leaking out. Although, the price you paid was that WE
learned about that defect.

EXECUTIVE: What do you want? Money? Or are you planning to leak this
information to the press?

JET: Just leave that old guy alone. That's all I want. It's a good deal,
isn't it? Ed would get lonely if she lost her chess partner.


The Bebop living room. Faye walks by and spots Ed on the floor with the
chess board.

FAYE: You're playing that thing again?

ED: Not again. Still.

FAYE: Still? You've been playing that thing this whole WEEK?!

ED: Yeah.

FAYE: I see. Well, good luck.


The junk heap. Jonathan smokes a cigar with a serene look on his face. The
old men float by.

CARLOS: Yo, newcomer. You seem happy today.

JONATHAN: Hi!

ANTONIO: He's a really easy going fellow, isn't he?

JOBIN: That he is...

Hex's room. Hex makes a final move.

HEX: Checkmate.


The Bebop. Ed screams and collapses.

ED: I lost...


Hex falls asleep.


SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY

COMING EPISODE

FAYE: Love... It is to believe everything.

SPIKE: Hey, now, are you serious?

FAYE: Love... It is the heart that provides for all.

JET: Come on... was that what the story was about?

FAYE: Love... It is the heart that accepts everything.

SPIKE: You know, this is getting fishy...

FAYE: Whitney... you loved me that much...

JET: You really can't trust the previews on this show...

FAYE: A romantic love story for all you lovers. Next episode: "My Funny

My Funny Valentine

OPENING CREDITS


Three years ago. A team of doctors in a cold blue room. Faye unconscious in
a tank. The tank sinks into the floor and locks.


The Bebop. Jet and Ed open up a panel in the floor to find a box of frozen
fish.

ED: Frozen, frozen, hard.

Jet scans it with a sensor.

JET: No good after all. It's full of dioxins. I had saved this as evidence
a while back -

Ed starts munching on them.

JET: Don't eat it, you malnutritioned kid!


The rotating part of the ship.

ED: Then you want to catch a fraud? A matrimonial fraud?

JET: Guess I have no choice.

ED: What kinda fraud? Is it big?

JET: Smallest of the small fry. I don't think Spike will be up for this...

ED: Ed wants chicken kabobs!

Ed floats away.

JET: Guess I'll do it alone.


The living room. Faye is asleep on the couch. She screams aloud in her
sleep.

FAYE: You have GOT to be kidding!

Ein barks at her.

FAYE: Give me a break...

Faye suddenly smells a nasty odor.

FAYE: This stinks!

Ein has filled his doggy toilet.


Faye and Ein walk to the bathroom.

FAYE: Really. Weren't you taught that you should wipe your own butt? I've
been thinking of who you remind me of. I know now. That guy with the
thin eye brows... Whitney Hagas Matsumoto. I wonder why I suddenly
was reminded of him... Do you want to know something about my past
that nobody else knows?

Ein yawns.


Session #15
MY FUNNY VALENTINE


Three years ago. Faye is emerged from the tank.


Faye awakens in the office of Doctor Baccus. Baccus examines Faye, while
his secretary, Miss Manley, works at a terminal.

BACCUS: Miss Manley, does she look resuscitated to you?

MANLEY: Yes, she does, Doctor.

BACCUS: Miss Manley, does she look like an old woman to you?

MANLEY: No, she doesn't, Doctor.

BACCUS: Do you think she has been successfully defrosted?

MANLEY: I believe so, Doctor.

BACCUS: Can you hear me? I am Doctor Baccus. Baccus, as in the Baccus that
drowned more humans than Neptune. Do you know about him? But I used
to be an alcoholic. Baccus was drowning thanks to Baccus. Hey, that
was great! 

Baccus breaks into laughter.

BACCUS: All right, open wide.

Faye opens her mouth and he checks her.

BACCUS: No problems. You have no wounds left, and the cells are dividing
nicely. Now, you only have one problem to solve. Oh, it's just a
simple process. The 30 million for the basic operation, and 54
years' worth of interest. Hey, how much is that?

MANLEY: 273 million. Add to that the hospital fees for a total of
300,028,000 Woolongs.

BACCUS: Yes, if you pay up that much, you will be free. Do you understand?

FAYE: I don't understand...

BACCUS: Yes, that's it - WHAT?!

FAYE: Where is this? Who am I?

Baccus laughs.

BACCUS: Miss Manley?

MANLEY: She is not acting, Doctor.


A hospital room.

WITNEY: I am Whitney Hagas Matsumoto, your lawyer.

FAYE: Lawyer?

WITNEY: At the request of the Totus Insurance Company I did some research
on your past. Miss Faye Valentine.

FAYE: Is that really my name?

WITNEY: It's a lovely name. It suits you very well.

FAYE: And?

WITNEY: How much of your memory do you still have?

Faye identifies various objects in the room.

FAYE: This is a TV, this is a hot water pot and this is a cellular phone.
I know everything except about myself.

WITNEY: I see.

FAYE: And?

WITNEY: According to the materials that remain, when you were 20... Well,
you are still 20. You seem to have been involved in a serious
accident.

FAYE: Accident?

WITNEY: Such that medical technology back then could not completely cure
you.

FAYE: I'm totally fine, as you can see. Not a scratch on my body - Wait,
what do you mean, "back then?"

WITNEY: That was 54 years ago. You have been in cold-sleep, or rather
cryogenically preserved, to this day. And you were able to reawaken
now that you could get the treatment you needed. Just like Sleeping
Beauty.

FAYE: You're kidding, right?

WITNEY: I am being serious.

FAYE: Then this is a dream...

WITNEY: No, it is definitely 2068 now. And this isn't a TV...

Witney pops open the device.

WITNEY: ...but a washing machine. And this isn't a hot water pot...

Witney lifts the device.

WITNEY: ...but an automatic face-washing machine.

Witney picks up a device.

WITNEY: And this is not a telephone, but a thermometer. You put this round
segment in your mouth -

FAYE: Don't mock me! You just start saying stuff like that, and you expect
me to believe -

Witney extends the round part of the device into Faye's mouth.

ELECTRONIC VOICE: Body temperature: 34.5 degrees Celsius. Pulse: 54. Blood
pressure: 40/75.

WITNEY: Still low.

FAYE: Wait a minute...!

WITNEY: Your memories end back when cellular telephones still looked like
this.

FAYE: Then tell me! What kind of accident?! What was I like before then?!
Who am I?!

WITNEY: Calm down. If you get excited, you -

FAYE: What?! What is going to happen -

Faye faints.

WITNEY: You'll get sleepy.


That evening. Faye sneaks out of the hospital. She runs until she reaches
a group of vending machines. Holograms light up selling beer and
miscellaneous products.

HOLOGRAM GIRL: Would you like one?

Faye is scared off. She runs into the road and sees an approaching vehicle.

FAYE: Hey! Hey!! HEY!!

The vehicle zooms off a few feet above her.

FAYE: W-Wait!

Faye chases after it. Behind her, Witney drives up in a car.

WITNEY: Miss Valentine!

Faye runs off the road. Witney parks and chases after her.

WITNEY: Wait!

FAYE: Don't get near me!

WITNEY: What can you do by running away?!

Faye slips and stumbles to the ground. Witney catches up.

WITNEY: Miss Valentine...

FAYE: I can't pay 300 million... It's unreasonable for them to choose to
resuscitate me and then expect me to pay the debt. I don't even know
anything about myself... What should I do?

Witney comforts her.

WITNEY: We can take it slow about the debt. I will help you. Your memory
might come back to you someday. If you keep living, you might meet
someone wonderful.


Witney carries Faye on his back. Faye notices a barcode tattoo on the back
of his neck.

FAYE: What is this?

WITNEY: An ID. This way, if you die, or if you forget yourself they will
know who you are and where you're from.

FAYE: And I don't have that...


Witney teaches Faye about the present.


One night. A ship police intercepts Faye and Witney on the road.

FAYE: What?!

WITNEY: The collection agency! The insurance company got impatient!

FAYE: What are we going to do?!

Witney drives into the forest.

WITNEY: At this rate, we're both doomed. You should get out of the car and
run.

FAYE: What about you?

WITNEY: We'll meet up at the Doctor's place. All right?

FAYE: Why are you helping me?

WITNEY: The prince must protect his sleeping beauty.

Faye gets out and Witney drives off. Faye runs and then suddenly, an
explosion.


Baccus' office.

BACCUS: We just went through the paper work. He told us to hand you all of
his assets if something happened to him... If you give us a thumb
print here, everything he owns will be yours.

FAYE: Whitney... You really cared for me...

BACCUS: Now, put your thumb here.

Baccus puts Faye's thumb on a screen. A slew of red numbers pop up.

FAYE: Why are the numbers all red?

BACCUS: Well, they say that debt is an asset...

FAYE: Debt...

Faye breaks down.

FAYE: You have GOT to be kidding!

She tosses a table.


The present. The Bebop.

FAYE: I was stupid back then, now that I think about it. I mean, he risked
his life to save me. His debt was nothing compared to mine. It really
wasn't that much...

Spike walks out of the bathroom.

FAYE: You were there the whole time?

SPIKE: Your story was way too long.


EYECATCH


The Bebop living room.

SPIKE: You are a horrible woman. I'm sure that guy is weeping in the after
life now that you ran away without paying the debt.

FAYE: I can't help it. It's not a sum that I can pay off.

SPIKE: Now you're being defiant about it.

FAYE: I've got some nerve, alright. I'm much older than you are.

SPIKE: Your past is all lies. What was that about Romani? Did you make this
story up too?

FAYE: It's neither a lie, nor a fake. I just don't know the truth. Like I
can help it.

ED: Welcome back!


Hammerhead returns to the Bebop.


The living room. Jet has a handcuffed fat man.

JET: This guy is known as the "Madam Killer." Well, he's just a cheap
matrimonial fraud.

SPIKE: Sure doesn't look like one.

Faye seems to recognize him.

JET: Well, I can do a good job even by myself. Got that?

Faye grabs the man and spots a barcode tattoo on the back of his neck.

FAYE: Whitney Hagas Matsumoto...

WITNEY: H-Hey... long time no see...


The rotating part of the ship.

JET: What kinda relationship do they have that she wants to talk to him
alone?

SPIKE: Apparently it's a pretty deep relationship.

JET: An old guy of her's?

SPIKE: They were made for each other.


The control room.

FAYE: You seem very, VERY well, Mister Lawyer.

WITNEY: Is it because I'm fat? Isn't that a biased opinion?

FAYE: I demand an explanation.

WITNEY: I got a fat implant after that accident. Got a little incision
around the armpit, and had it squeezed in -

FAYE: NOT THAT!

WITNEY: It's been three years? You look healthy, I'm glad.

FAYE: Yeah, I'm sure you are. Did you think that you completely reinvented
yourself by doing that?

WITNEY: I wanted to start over... start everything over...

FAYE: And so you went with matrimonial fraud.

WITNEY: To think you're a bounty hunter... This must have been destined.

FAYE: So everyone was in on it?

WITNEY: Back then, I couldn't do anything else. Because he sheltered me,
the doctor... Maybe it was better to have been caught. I couldn't
wish for anything more than having you hand me over to the police.


The living room.

JET: You think it's all right to leave them alone?

SPIKE: You worried about her?

JET: I just thought that she might let him go.

SPIKE: Does she have that much sympathy in her heart?

JET: Women as insistent as her tend to be the ones who get emotionally
swayed by their exes.

SPIKE: Is that so?

JET: Women don't work on reason.

Ed picks up an incoming call.

ED: Welcome, visitors!


A police ship floats next to the Bebop.

VOICE: So are you the ones that reported to us?

JET: Yeah, I want to claim a bounty.

VOICE: I see.

The man in the ship is Doctor Baccus. The pilot is Miss Manley.

BACCUS: Miss Manley, prepare to rendezvous.

MANLEY: Yes, Inspector.


The control room.

WITNEY: I'm glad I was able to meet you one last time. Take care...

Faye approaches Witney and tries to unlock his handcuffs with a lock pick.

FAYE: I won't hand you over to them!

WITNEY: It's all right. You really don't have to mind me!

Failing at unlocking the handcuffs, she draws her gun and shoots apart the
chain.


The gravity on the ship is suddenly deactivated. Spike and Jet float in the
rotating part of the ship.

SPIKE: Are they ready to depart already?

JET: Is she gonna let him go?

SPIKE: She might be letting him go.

JET: You wanna bet?

SPIKE: We're splitting it 60-40.

They struggle to float to the hanger.

JET: Dammit, hurry up, Spike!

SPIKE: I'm trying!


The hanger. Faye stuffs Witney into Red Tail's pod.

WITNEY: I-It's impossible to get both of us in this!

FAYE: I don't care. Breathe out some more! EXHALE!

Spike and Jet enter.

JET: Hey, wait!

Faye points her gun at them.

FAYE: I'm not letting you have him!

JET: She took the guy and not the money!

SPIKE: Jet captured him!

FAYE: I have to repay my debt to him. So I have the right to do what I want
with him, and the bounty on him!

SPIKE: Amazing. She clearly states a pointless argument...

JET: That's what I told you. Women don't work on reason.

WITNEY: Get me off of this thing!

JET: Are you gonna let him go?

FAYE: We'll see!

She shoots. Spike and Jet dodge. Jet accidentally closes the hanger doors
for Red Tail to launch. Red Tail takes off.


Ed and Ein floating in the living room.

ED: Visitor, thanks for coming!


The Red Tail in space.

WITNEY: Where are you going? What are you going to do with me?

FAYE: I want you to tell me the truth. Why was I there? Where does the
truth end, and where do the lies start?

Spike in Swordfish II chases after Faye. He shoots at Red Tail.

FAYE: What are you doing?!

SPIKE: If you're not careful, I'll hit the pod.

FAYE: I'm not going to be easy on you!

Faye shoots back.

SPIKE: That's MY line!

Faye fires blinders at Swordfish. Spike maneuvers around them and blow out
Red Tail's engines.

SPIKE: You're causing me a lot of trouble...

FAYE: Who am I?

WITNEY: Do you really want to know your own past? Are you prepared for the
consequences?

FAYE: I am!

WITNEY: I see...

Silence.

FAYE: Wait a minute.

WITNEY: Well, I don't really know myself.

FAYE: You're so -

BACCUS: Who you really are, where you are from, and where you will go. That
is a question that every human asks himself at least once in his
life.

FAYE: And who are you?

BACCUS: However, puberty is the only time you need to worry about things
like that. Only bored individuals think such thoughts after a
certain age.

FAYE: I've heard that voice before...

BACCUS: Can you see me?

Baccus and Manley float by in their police ship.

FAYE: Is that... the doctor and the nurse?

WITNEY: Seems that way.

FAYE: Didn't you say something like that doctor passed away?

WITNEY: No, no... I didn't mean it THAT way...

FAYE: YOU! How many lies do you have to tell before you're satisfied?!

Witney cowers with fear.

BACCUS: You were cryogenically preserved there. That we are certain of. I
guarantee it.

FAYE: What about my past? Who in the world am I?

BACCUS: I gave you the name Valentine. I named you after my favorite song.
As for everything else, all data was lost back in that Gate
accident. So I don't know who you are, or why you were put in
cold-sleep.

SPIKE: He wasn't a cop?

A fleet of police ships surround them.

OFFICER: The patrol ship over there. State your department. I repeat. The
patrol ship over there. State your department and registration
number.

MANLEY: Doctor... at this rate, we will be apprehended.

BACCUS: It's truly unfortunate, but it's best that we not meddle in this
any longer.

MANLEY: Let's give up.

BACCUS: So, farewell, Whitney. Take care of yourself.

MANLEY: We're sorry!

They float away.

WITNEY: H-Hey, wait! Uncle! UNCLE!

FAYE: Uncle?

They take off.

FAYE: I'll take my bounty here and now!

SPIKE: There ya go! 


A jail room at a police station. Witney is behind bars.

FAYE: Good riddance. I guess you're getting paid back for all the lies that
you told.

WITNEY: There is one truth that I have spoken. That I fell in love with you
while you were asleep in love with a sleeping beauty.

Faye stares at him. Witney blushes.

WITNEY: No, just kidding! I'm lying! It's a lie!


Outside the police station.

FAYE: Did you want me to come back that badly?

SPIKE: You sure got a big mouth.

FAYE: You were jealous.

SPIKE: You really are a heartless woman.

FAYE: I guess I don't know anything about my past anymore...

SPIKE: Isn't that something that really doesn't matter?

FAYE: You think that way because you have a past.

SPIKE: No matter the past, you still have a future.

Spike flips Faye a coin.

FAYE: What's this?

SPIKE: Your share... of the 19,800 on his head.

FAYE: 19,800?

SPIKE: The smallest of the small fry.


The Bebop.

JET: It wasn't 198,000? I put an extra digit in there...


The living room. Faye sleeps on the couch. Ein, with eyebrows drawn on him
in black marker, sleeps on the floor.


SLEEPING BEAST


CLOSING CREDITS


COMING EPISODE

JET: So. The next episode of Cowboy Bebop I admit, is really heavy and
depressing. The only people that show up are well-aged musty men. I
hate to say this, but it is rather lackluster. Children shouldn't
watch it. Ladies should avoid it, too. And to top it off, it's better
for young guys to not watch either. Next episode: "Black Dog
Serenade." Just to all the old guys - make sure you watch it.

Next Session
BLACK DOG SERENADE

�ĝğďŕ�sil - September 21, 2005 03:11 AM (GMT)
Black Dog Serenade

OPENING CREDITS


A prison ship. The barred doors open and close. Dead policemen are littered
across the floor, bleeding. An inmate named Tucan with a wine bottle
approaches Udai Taxim, a dangerous man.

TUCAN: Hey, did you do that by yourself? Pretty good!

Tucan drinks from the bottle. Udai stares at him.

TUCAN: Hey, let's be amiable. We shouldn't waste what our whimsical god has
given us.

UDAI: God?

TUCAN: Or rather, for these guys it would be the devil. Want some? It's
Dom Perignon.

Tucan gives Udai the bottle. Udai pours the wine into the mouth of one of
the dead officers.

UDAI: Cheers. To this ship that has charmed the devil.


The ship passes through hyperspace.


Session #16
BLACK DOG SERENADE


The Bebop. Faye complains to Jet. Jet cuts his bonsai trees cigarette in
mouth.

FAYE: What in the world is going on with the showers in this place?! This
is the fourth time! The FOURTH time! Even Buddha gets upset after the
third time! Hey, are you listening?

JET: The shower broke, and only cold water comes out. And the faucet fell
off.

FAYE: If you know about it, fix it!

JET: I'm busy right now.

FAYE: You can do THAT any time you want -

Jet's communicator rings. Faye grabs it before he can.

FAYE: We're busy!

Faye hangs up.

JET: Don't just hang up! What if it's an emergency?

The communicator rings again. Faye smiles.

JET: Oh, all right. You'll be happy if I fix it, right?

FAYE: Hi, he'll call you back. What's your name? OK, Fad. I'll tell him.

JET: Fad? Did you say Fad?

Jet's cigarette in his robotic left hand begins to burn down to his
fingers.

FAYE: It's not hot?

Jet notices.

FAYE: Why don't you fix that?

JET: I told you I'll fix it.

FAYE: No, your arm. I mean, reconstructive surgery doesn't cost that much
nowadays, right?

JET: This ship is my ship. And this arm is my arm. Don't tell me what I
need to do.


The prison ship. The pilot, the one remaining officer of the ship is held
at gunpoint by a large inmate named Nero. A seedy inmate by the name of Dig
make an announcement.

DIG: Now, you death row inmates. I'm sorry to say, but the cruise to the
prison on Pluto has been canceled.

The others laugh.

DIG: This ship will now enter a mystery tour -

PILOT: What are you going to do? Do you think this ship is enough for you
to escape?

DIG: I wasn't talking to you...

OFFICER: S-Stop wasting your time like this. If you surrender peacefully -

Dig shoots him several times in the back.

DIG: I told you to shut up.

NERO: Don't get so hotheaded, Dig.

TUCAN: Oh, man... there goes our precious hostage.

DIG: I'm not letting anyone tell me what to do. If you got a problem with
that, step forward!

Udai approaches Dig.

DIG: YOU!

Dig points his gun at Udai. A concealed blade drops from Udai's sleeve down
to his hand. He slits Dig's throat.

TUCAN: I remember... You're... yeah... That assassin for the syndicate...
Udai.


A bridge on Ganymede. Jet drops a cigarette into the water. A gun is
pointed at his side. It is his old ISSP partner, Fad.

FAD: Caught you red-handed tossing a cigarette butt. That would be a fine
of 20 thousand Woolongs, Jet.

JET: Then I'll need to collect that loan I gave you with 7 years' worth of
interest, to cover it... and then some...

FAD: When did you buy me that coffee? That's long past the statute of
limitations!

Fad holsters his six-shooter.

JET: So you still think you're a gunman with a gun like that? Sure is a
waste of ISSP tax money.

FAD: This is?

JET: No, your salary.

FAD: Yeah, really...

Jet offers Fad a cigarette.

FAD: No, I quit.

JET: Huh, I see...

FAD: Tenth day. It's a hard world to live in for smokers, anyway.

JET: Hmm... I never thought you would... And, what was it that you wanted
to tell me?

FAD: There was trouble on the prison transport ship headed for Pluto. That
was six hours ago. Apparently there was an electrical malfunction. The
prisoners took advantage of it, and rioted. I don't know the details.

JET: And?

FAD: Udai is on that ship. We don't know where the ship went after it left
the Ganymede Gate. The ISSP is frantically searching.

JET: Hey, you... don't get any stupid ideas. It's out of your jurisdiction.

FAD: You think it's a stupid idea? The reason you quit being a cop was...
because of when -

JET: Now THAT is past the statute of limitations.

FAD: If after all this, he lives on wouldn't that left arm of yours cry,
Jet?

JET: That story doesn't interest me anymore...


A dark day long ago. A row of warehouses. Fad and Jet separate.

FAD: Jet! I'll go around from this side!

JET: Got it!

Jet finds Udai standing alone.

JET: Udai Taxim! You are under arrest!

A bright light shines into Jet's eyes from above. Jet covers his eyes with
his left arm.

JET: A trap?!

A loud gunshot.


The prison ship.

TUCAN: What are ya gonna do? The guys from the ISSP are gonna come any
minute! And the pilot's dead.

UDAI: We're gonna break through, of course.

NERO: Easy for you to say. We only got enough weapons for self-defense.
What are ya gonna do?

An inmate named Elroy with a scar on the left side of his face takes the
controls of the ship.

ELROY: I'm sure they've set up a barricade. It would be better for us to
attack and break through where they're thin.

NERO: Can you steer this thing?

ELROY: I was a cop on Venus once.

TUCAN: And now you're imprisoned for life?

ELROY: Cops are human too...


The Bebop. Jet opens Hammerhead's hatch. Ed hangs from Hammerhead's hook.

ED: You got back?

JET: I'm heading out. It's dangerous, so stand back.

Ed drops to the floor, landing on her feet.

ED: You're going out. Get souvenirs!

JET: Ed... If I don't come back, water the bonsai for me.

Jet climbs into Hammerhead.

ED: Yup!

Ed dances around.

ED: Bonsai, wise guy, chicken pot pie. Lights shine bright in the many
towns.


Space. A fleet of police ships approach the prison ship.

OFFICER: HQ, do you read? This is Group D-7. We have spotted the prison
transport ship. The ship is sending an SOS. Apparently they ran
into some mechanical trouble.

UDAI: We are releasing a lifeboat. On the boat are 4 officers and 12
inmates. We're requesting a pickup.

The lifeboat explodes blowing away the most of the fleet. Gun turrets on
the prison ship fire, making short work of the rest of the police ships.


EYECATCH


Jet and Fad's ship approach scraps of the police ships in space.

OFFICER: Number 12, Number 13, no response. We request emergency backup.
Repeat, we request emergency backup. We have lost sight of the
transport. Current location is seven-four-five. Group D-7,
initiate code ten-eight. Repeat, we request emergency backup.


FAD: No good. Apparently the police don't know where they went either.

JET: What do you think their next move will be?

FAD: If they are to hijack another ship, they'll be somewhere close to
their original route, at a place where they can hide.

JET: I don't think so.

FAD: What?

JET: Europa.

FAD: Europa? What makes you think that?

JET: If I was Udai, I would go back to Europa.

FAD: But, Udai is already... He hasn't contacted the syndicate in quite a
while.

JET: He is old-fashioned. So much that he's not the right kind of guy to
live in this day and age... He'll go back. I know it...

FAD: The Black Dog that won't let go once he bites, huh? OK, Europa it is.
If you're wrong, you're paying for fuel.


The Bebop. The showers malfunction.

FAYE: Wait! What the.. OW! What part of this is fixed!


The bonsai room. Ed hoses the entire room, over-watering the bonsai. Ein
jumps at the water. The water runs out. Spike approaches.

SPIKE: What's this? Jet's gonna have a fit!

ED: He asked me. He's not comin' back!

SPIKE: It's okay, just bring something to wipe this up.

ED: Okay!

Ed and Ein run off.

SPIKE What's up with him, leaving his precious bonsai here?

Faye approaches.

FAYE: Hey, Jet! What the hell is going on?!


The prison ship. Udai attempts to contact the syndicate.

UDAI: It's me.

VOICE: You seem to have done something outrageous.

UDAI: We need a new ship.

VOICE: There is no further relationship between us and Udai Taxim.

UDAI: Are you betraying me?

VOICE: If you want to feel that way, go ahead.

UDAI: I have information.

VOICE: That threat won't work anymore. Times have changed... while you were
in prison.


Jet and Fad's ship. They find the prison ship.

FAD: You win. He's there.

JET: We should split up. I'll come around from the other end.

Jet walks off to board Hammerhead.

FAD: You're crazy! That ship doesn't have any decent weapons!

JET: You know how I work better than anyone else, right?

FAD: Hey, Jet... Why don't you quit being a bounty hunter and pair up with
me again?

JET: I'll think about it if we get back.


The prison ship. They detect Hammerhead and Fad's ship.

ELROY: Heat source detected.

TUCAN: Someone after us?

ELROY: If it's the ISSP, I doubt they would come alone.

Nero enters with heavy artillery.

NERO: I found something good in the cargo bay. And we have the perfect
target.


Fad's ship.

FAD: All right, Jet... We'll approach them using this ice for cover. Stay
there until I signal -

Jet takes off in Hammerhead.

FAD: JET!


The prison ship. Tucan mans a gun turret.

TUCAN: I don't know who ya are, but we'll give ya a warm welcome!

He shoots at Hammerhead. Jet dodges the shots. A panel on the prison ship
opens and Nero in a space suit fires a rocket at Hammerhead. Tucan
continues firing.

TUCAN: Here ya go!

Hammerhead's engine is hit. Jet harpoons the side of the prison ship and
draws Hammerhead to it. Fad's ship is hit by one of Nero's rockets.

NERO: Bingo!

Fad's ship crashes into the side where Nero stands, crushing him.

Jet ejects his MONO pod and enters the prison ship. Tucan and Udai see him
with security cameras.

TUCAN: That guy's got guts to come here alone.

Jet spots one of the security cameras. He signals in one direction and
shoots out the camera.

TUCAN: What the hell is he? Hey, where are you - ?

UDAI: He's my visitor.


Air leaks out of the ship, where Fad crashed.


Tucan runs to the hanger.

TUCAN: You've got to be kidding. I'm not gonna put up with all of this!

He opens the hatch to the hanger, not knowing that there is a hole there.
He is sucked into the vacuum of space.


A dark hallway. Udai shoots at Jet. Jet dodges. Jet returns fire.


The control room. Fad loads his six-shooter with one bullet. Elroy is shot
dead.


The hallway. Udai and Jet fight.

UDAI: You came all the way here to see me?

JET: I didn't come here because I wanted to!

Udai wrestles Jet to the floor. He steps on Jet's right hand.

UDAI: Don't say that, I came out here just to greet you.

He aims his gun and shoots at Jet's face. Jet blocks the bullet with his
robotic left arm.

JET: I didn't want to come but something else wanted to see you...

UDAI: What?

JET: The left arm that I lost!

Jet head butts Udai. Udai tosses a blade into Jet's left leg.

UDAI: What a happy camper you are. You never knew anything, did you?

Jet pulls out the blade.

JET: What?

UDAI: I wasn't the one who shot you back then. It was your partner. It was
all planned out from the beginning. To get rid of you, who was a
threat to the syndicate. You were long since betrayed. You were
used -

Fad shoots Udai in the head.

JET: Why did you shoot? Was it because he was telling the truth? You came
here to shut him up for good? Why aren't you answering me?!

FAD: It was your fault, Jet. It ended up this way because you went in on
your own. You know what happens to people who go against the
syndicate, right? Either they all quit like you... or they die. We
can't live on with our pretty little ideals.

JET: That's why you betrayed me and kept fooling me?!

FAD: I wanted to team up with you like back then.

Fad points his gun at Jet.

FAD: Time for farewells, Jet.

As Fad pulls the trigger, Jet ducks, grabs a gun and shoots him. Fad falls.

JET: Fad!

FAD: Jet...

Jet examines his gun and sees that it was only loaded with one bullet.

JET: You didn't... Did you let me shoot on purpose?

FAD: Can I have... a smoke?

Jet puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.

FAD: I guess... I couldn't quit smoking...

Fad dies.


SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...

OPENING CREDITS


The Bebop floats fueless in Io space.


The Bebop living room. Jet presents an empty box to the crew.

JET: This was the most special of the special. It was an emergency ration
for true emergencies that was saved for the last of the last resorts.
All I'm asking is who ate this.

SPIKE: Grudges over food sure are scary.

JET: Spike, by perchance, was it you?

SPIKE: If I was the culprit, I wouldn't leave the empty box lying around
like that.

ED: Ed is hungry.

FAYE: Maybe you ate it yourself, but are pretending to be upset because
we found the empty box?

JET: What?!

FAYE: We haven't had anything to eat for two whole days! Don't you call a
situation like this an emergency?!

SPIKE: I wanna eat stuff like fried beefun noodles...

JET: We're outta gas! We can't do anything about it! If you could hold out
like this a bit longer we'll reach Europa soon thanks to inertia.

ED: Tummy's caving in!

FAYE: If only we could use that energy to propel ourselves...

JET: You keep mouthing off like that and I'll toss you out into absolute
zero.

SPIKE: And a stir-fry of liver and chives would be good, too...

FAYE: Sounds good. At least it's better than aimlessly floating around this
place.

Ed finds a pistachio nut in her pocket. She takes off the shell and
prepares to eat it. The rest stare at her ravenously. Ed screams.

A large triangular ship crashes into Bebop. The nut slips from Ed's
fingers.

Ein eats the nut.

FAYE: That was some collision...

Jet tries to contact the ship.

JET: Hey! Can you hear me? Answer me! Hey!

The ship jets off.

FAYE: Isn't this a hit-and-run?!

The Bebop is suddenly pulled into Io's gravitational field.

JET: This is bad! The shock from that collision changed our trajectory...

SPIKE: What did what to who?

FAYE: What's going on?!


The Bebop crash-lands on Io.


Session #17
MUSHROOM SAMBA


The Bebop control room.

ED: Huh?

FAYE: Wow... Where is this place? This is so uncivilized!

SPIKE: I don't think that's our problem...

JET: We have to start by checking the ship. Can you go get some food?

Faye suddenly looks uneasy. She grabs her stomach.

JET: What?

FAYE: I suddenly feel... a stabbing pain...

JET: What are you trying to pull?

Faye runs into the bathroom. Ein pushes the empty box to Jet. Jet picks it
up and examines the bottom.

JET: This expired a year ago...

SPIKE: I'm glad I didn't eat it.

JET: Serves you right. This is divine retribution!

They're stomachs rumble.

JET: Let's get to it...


The Engine Room. Jet and Spike examine the smoking engine.

SPIKE: Whatcha gonna do?

Ed pops up.

ED: Ed will help too!

Ed tugs at the handlebars. They break off.

SPIKE: We're fine here, so go outside and find us some food.

ED: Okay!

Ed skips off.


The rotating part of the ship. Ed puts on a pair of socks.

ED: Gotta wear my socks to go out, to go out.

Ed slips and falls. She takes off the socks.


The Great Io Desert. Ed and Ein wander aimlessly. They lie down.

ED: Nothing here...

The triangular ship flies overhead.

ED: It's that hit-and-run ship!

Ed and Ein chase after it.

ED: Wait, wait! Wait, wait!

The ship flies out of sight.

ED: Wait, wait!


Ed stops. She picks up a scent. 

ED: Smell...

Ed and Ein sniff around.

ED: Smell... food...

Following the trail they find a watermelon vender with a truck full of
melons.

ED: FOOD!


They run to the truck.

ED: Gimme!

MELON MAN: 1000 Woolongs each, including tax. Cash only. No money cards or
cash cards allowed.

ED: I don't have money.

MELON MAN: Then hurry home, kid.

A slick sports car pulls up. Coffee, a tall attractive woman with an afro,
walks out.

COFFEE: Can I have one?

MELON MAN: 1000 Woolongs each. Cash only. Cards are -

The man notices Ed and Ein salivating in front of the watermelons.

MELON MAN: Kid, no use staring. If you want food, go someplace like the
town.

Coffee hands the man a 1000-Woolong bill.

COFFEE: I don't need change. In exchange...

She flashes a picture of a man with a phone number written on the bottom.

COFFEE: If you see this man, gimme a call. Thanks!

The man takes the bill. Coffee takes a watermelon. Coffee drives off. Ed
and Ein stow aboard the car in the trunk.


Coffee stops at a gas station. Two policemen approach her.

OFFICER A: Excuse us.

OFFICER B: We would like to check your baggage.

COFFEE: Something wrong?

OFFICER A: Apparently, a broker on the wanted list for illegal mushroom
sales made a getaway to this town.

COFFEE: What a coincidence. I'm after that bounty as well.

OFFICER A: A cowboy?

OFFICER B: We're gonna check out your trunk.

COFFEE: Go ahead, feel free.

They open the trunk. To the surprise of all of them they find Ed and Ein
asleep.

OFFICER A: Hey!

OFFICER B: All right! FREEZE!

The policeman pull out their guns and handcuffs.

COFFEE: Now, wait a minute -

OFFICER A: All right, stay still -

COFFEE: I don't know anything about this!

OFFICER A: Turn around! Hands on the ground!

COFFEE: What are you doing?!

OFFICER B: Now put your hands on the ground!

COFFEE: Let go of me!!

OFFICER B: HURRY UP!

Ed and Ein wake from the commotion and slip away onto the streets.


Ed and Ein. walk into the city.

ED: Food, food, do you have any? Oh, you don't? Oh, you do? Boy, am I
hungry...

They spot the mushroom dealer, Domino, carrying a bag. He eats a hotdog. Ed
and Ein rush toward him.

ED: Meanie!

DOMINO: What?

Ed grabs him.

ED: Gimme! Gimme something!

DOMINO: Dammit, stop hanging all over me!

A man dragging a coffin behind him by a rope approaches Domino.

SHAFT BROTHER: HEY! I won't let you tell me you forgot who I am, Domino!

DOMINO: Let's see...

SHAFT BROTHER: Come on! Remember, dammit! I'm the younger of the Shaft
Brothers that bought mushrooms from you!

DOMINO: I really can't recall...

SHAFT BROTHER: You do want to know why I drag an empty coffin around like
this, don't you? It's because I'm going to go home after
putting your corpse inside -

A truck drives by and runs over the coffin.

ED: Pieces... All in pieces!

DOMINO: What was what to who?

SHAFT BROTHER: My big bro ate a mushroom he bought from you and laughed and
laughed, and twisted his intestines to death!

DOMINO: A happy way to die.

Ed laughs.

SHAFT BROTHER: Shut up! Speaking of which, it's all your fault!

DOMINO: That's what I call an unjust resentment!

ED: Ed is hungry, too!

SHAFT BROTHER: Take THIS!

He pulls out a grenade launcher.

Domino runs off. Mushrooms drop from his bag.

SHAFT BROTHER: Wait, you bastard! Dammit!

The Shaft Brother runs after Domino.

ED: Food!

Ein eats one immediately.

ED: Aah! Don't, Ein, we have to share!

Ein hick-ups and begins to squeak uncontrollably.

ED: Ein?

Ed sniffs a mushroom.

ED: Bad mushroom?


EYECATCH


Outside the Bebop. A plate with a single mushroom lies on top of an ironing
board. Faye approaches it. Ed and Ein look from the shadows.

FAYE: This for real?

Faye takes it and eats it.

FAYE: Delicious!

She walks away.


Moments later. Another plate with a single mushroom. Jet approaches it. Ed
and Ein continue looking from the shadows.

JET: This really can't be happening. Really. This really has no way of
happening.

Jet picks it up and eats it. Jet walks away satisfied.

Moments later. Another plate with a single mushroom. Spike gives it a good
look. He casually walks by the table and swipes the mushroom into his mouth
while walking away. Ed and Ein continue looking from the shadows.


The Bebop.

Faye walks into the bathroom. She hick-ups and her eyes turn
dull.


Jet walks by the bonsai room. He stops at the door step, hicks-up and his
eyes turn dull.


The hall. Spike walks halfway up the steps leading into the control room.
He hick-ups and his eyes turn dull. He takes a few steps forward, looks up
and sees that his journey up the stairs is endless.


In the bathroom. Faye sees the ceiling rise endlessly.


The bonsai room. Jet converses with his bonsai and laughs.

JET: Hey... You know, the world really is a great place...

He scratches his head.

JET: Did I just say something?


Spike continues his journey up the stairs. He encounters a bullfrog. Spike
stops.

BULLFROG: Hey, mister. This is a stairway to heaven. You know that, right?

SPIKE: An obnoxious little frog...

Spike continues walking up.

BULLFROG: I don't care anymore... I warned you!


Ed and Ein watch Spike stepping on the same step over and over trying to
get to the control room.


The bathroom. Faye sees the mouth of the toilet bowl high above her head.
It begins to overflow. She is submerged in water. Thousands of fish swim
around her.


Ed and Ein watch Faye swim the breaststroke standing up one step before the
toilet.


The bonsai room. Jet continues conversing with his bonsai.

JET: Yeah, yeah, that's it. I now know the secrets of the universe.

He laughs.

JET: By the way... who was I?

Ed and Ein walk by.

ED: So these mushrooms are inedible after all...

Ein nods and barks.


Ed and Ein watch "Big Shot" on the monitor outside the ship.

PUNCH: So, as you can tell, it's time for another episode of BIG SHOT!

JUDY: We'll introduce you to more and more bounties this week! So, batting
first for us today is...


PUNCH: This man, Domino Walker. He's currently wanted for selling illegal
mushrooms.

ED: That's the guy we just saw!

JUDY: The bounty is a conservative 1.2 mil.

ED: That's cowgirl, Ein. We earn money and buy food! Ein, you're a cow-woof
woof!.


Ed and Ein gather equipment from the Bebop.


Ed steps on a powered scooter.

ED: Here we go! One! Two! Five! Four! Hello!

Ed jets off.


The police station. Coffee is being interrogated.

OFFICER: Hey, don't underestimate the police!

COFFEE: I really don't know anything!

OFFICER: Then why did you have a strange kid and a dog in the trunk of your
car?!

The policeman's phone rings. He picks it up.

OFFICER: Hello... Yes? Oh, it's you, Sally. Really... You're so hopeless...

He turns away from Coffee.

OFFICER: I told you so many times not to call me at work...

Through the window, Coffee spots Ed and Ein speed by.

OFFICER: And? Yeah, yeah, and that's it? I mean, I didn't mean it THAT way
when I said "that's it?"...

She carefully grabs her keys and escapes.

OFFICER: Yeah, yeah, like that. I love you, Sally. Got it. Tonight at 7 it
is. Bye-bye!

He hangs up. Coffee is gone. Outside, she drives away.

OFFICER: HEY!


At an outdoors bar. The Shaft Brother speedily eats flavored ice. Sitting a
table away are Antonio, Carlos and Jobin.

ANOTONIO: What's wrong, young'un? Lookin' like that...

CARLOS: Did your woman run off without you?

JOBIN: What to say...

SHAFT BROTHER: None of your business, old geezers.

He spots Ed and Ein speed off. He tries to finish the ice quickly and gets
a splitting headache.

ANTONIO: Oh, man... that's for eating all at once.

CARLOS: They say when you're in a hurry, go around.

JOBIN: Is that right?


Ed stops outside of town.

ED: He's not here...

She spots the triangular ship.

ED: Aah! That hit-and-run ship!


In the ship. Domino tends to mushrooms growing on bark.

DOMINO: I'm sure they never even dreamed that I was raising these in here.

He plucks one and tosses it into a full bag.

DOMINO: This one's bad. Well, making an emergency landing here was the only
miscalculation I had -

He turns around and Ed and Ein startle him.

ED: Were you surprised?

DOMINO: I was. What the hell are you guys?

ED: Why are you here?

DOMINO: That's my line! How did you get in here in the first place?

ED: The door was open.

DOMINO: Is that so?!

Ed points two gas guns at Domino.

ED: Culprit of the hit-and-run, prepare to get arrested! Stinkbug gas!

She pulls the triggers. Gas sprays out. Domino runs away.

ED: Wait, wait, wait!

Ed and Ein chase after him.


They run outside. A train is about to cross. The Shaft Brother and the
watermelon vender in his truck wait side by side. The Shaft Brother spots
Domino and Ed. The train passes. Domino has gotten himself on top of it.
The Shaft Brother punches out the watermelon vender, takes his truck and
speeds after the train. He climbs onto the train and confronts Domino.

SHAFT BROTHER: Don't think that you can get away from me!

He pulls out his grenade launcher and fires at Domino. Domino dodges.

Coffee catches up with the train. She pulls out her own grenade launcher.

COFFEE: Don't get in my way!

She fires at the Shaft Brother and misses.

Ed and Ein chase after the train in the scooter. Ed, with Ein on her back,
hops off the scooter, skips on Coffee's head and grabs onto the train.

ED: Ein! Growl!

Ein runs after Domino. He bites one of the mushroom bags. 

DOMINO: C-Come on! Let go of me!

Ein tosses back the bag. It flies into the Shaft Brother's face. The Shaft
Brother loses grip and falls from the train and through Coffee's
windshield. Coffee's car flips over and explodes. Both miraculously
survive.

Ed runs after Domino and makes threatening gestures.

ED: BOO!

A cow is before the train on the tracks. The train suddenly brakes. Domino
falls off the train in front of the cow. Ed lands on top of him. The train
stops.

ED: Gotcha!

DOMINO: W-Wait... T-These mushrooms are worth 100,000 each. Let me go, and
I'll give them to you.

ED: Why?

DOMINO: Think about which one is worth more.

ED: I dunno.

DOMINO: A-Are you an idiot?! Take the mushrooms!

ED: Okay!

Ed takes the bag and tosses it in the air.

Ein barks at the cow

EIN (Subtitles): Thank you.

The cow moos back

COW (Subtitles): Oh, it's no problem.


Sunset. Spike is on the roof of the Bebop. Faye regains consciousness on
the floor of the bathroom with toilet paper in her mouth. Jet makes up in
the hallway, mouth red from eating lipstick.


Ed runs into a tent outside the Bebop with the bag.

ED: Yahoo! Dinner! Mushroom!


In the tent.

FAYE: 100,000 each? Really?

JET: That sure would make some money.

FAYE: These are real?

A policeman approaches the tent outside. Jet, Ed and Faye walk outside.

OFFICER: Excuse me. I'm with the police. I want to ask a few questions
about Domino, an illegal mushroom dealer.

JET: Unfortunately, we have no clue.

FAYE: I'm so sorry we can't be of any help.

ED: Ed knows who that -

Jet and Faye cover Ed's mouth. Faye and Jet laugh nervously.

FAYE: Don't mind her...

Ed struggles free.

ED: In exchange, I got...

They cover her mouth again.

JET: Really...

FAYE: She's a troublesome kid...


Spike walks outside, still dazed, holding the bag of mushrooms.

OFFICER: Excuse me, sir.

He tests the mushrooms with a scanner.

OFFICER: They're okay. He must really like shitake mushrooms. Well, sorry
to bother you.

The policeman leaves.


Space. The Bebop.

JET: Here's dinner.

SPIKE: What's the menu?

JET: Shitake stir-fry, shitake stew, shitake salad, and a shitake dessert.

ED: Yaaaaaay!

FAYE: Again? How many days has it been?

SPIKE: No... I can't eat anymore.

JET: Quit complaining, and be thankful that we can even eat!

ED: Thankful!

Ein hick-ups.


LIFE IS BUT A DREAM...

JET: A videotape that was delivered to the Bebop with no return address.
Because we wanted to view the tape, things took a turn for the
unexpected. No, actually it doesn't go anywhere. At first glance, the

forced but what will you get out of it all? Next episode: "Speak Like

Session #18
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD


The deck of the Bebop. Jet hangs clothes out to dry. He tells Ed a story.

JET: And so, the turtle took him to a palace called Ryuuguujou as a reward.

ED: Ryuuguujou?

JET: Yeah. At that palace, they held a welcome party for him. Beautiful
women and scrumptious feasts. Breams and halibut swam about and so he
spent his time as if in a dream.

ED: I see...

SPIKE: I haven't eaten breams or halibut in quite a while...

JET: Days passed before he knew it, and when he was about to go back he was
given the Tamatebako as a souvenir.

ED: Tamatebako? Is that yummy?

JET: It's not food. It's a chest with treasure inside.

SPIKE: I haven't seen any treasure in quite a while either...

JET: You guys are so tasteless. This is an old fantasy tale!

ED: The turtle's Tamatebako?

JET: What were you listening to...?

Ed points up. A delivery truck with a turtle painted on it lands on the
deck of the Bebop.


Faye flies back to the Bebop in Red Tail.

FAYE: I should quit the horses now.

She land on the deck and opens the door of her MONO pod. Jet is waiting for
her with a package in his hand.

JET: Pay up 6300 Woolongs.

FAYE: What, where did that come from?

JET: This was for you.

FAYE: For... me?

JET: C.O.D. even. To top it off, no return address. I had no choice but to
accept it -

Faye slams the pod door and takes off.

JET: H-Hey! Wait!! HEY! What about the 6300 Woolongs?!

SPIKE: Busy woman.


In Red Tail.

FAYE: Could it be a collection agency from the life extension firm? Or...
No, could it be... Oooh... I just have too many things it could be...
So for now, I'll just run away!

Faye flies away.


The Bebop living room..

JET: Don't you think it's fishy? For a woman who always claims other
people's property as her own to run away without even touching it?

SPIKE: She seems to have picked up a lot of grudges from all over, though.

JET: I should do an explosives test and a biochemical test just in case...
No! I should return this to the courier service and have them refund
the money I paid for her sake...

SPIKE: rips open the package.

JET: Hey, Spike!

From it, a rectangular black box slips out. Spike examines it.

SPIKE: What the hell is this?

JET: Does it make any ticking noises?

SPIKE: Nope.

Ed finds information on the internet.

ED: I got data! Data from the courier service!

Jet reads the web page.

JET: The sender is... a nonprofit nunnery in Europa?!

ED: There's more...

Jet reads .

JET: Pluto Prison? Asteroid Actors' Studio? Fourth Uranus Observatory?
Venus News Network? Forwarded, forwarded, and forwarded some more...
This thing's been passed around the entire solar system...

ED: Here.

JET: Due to the explosion of the Lunar Gate, all data from before 2022 has
been lost.

SPIKE: An antique.

Ein sniffs the box.


The streets of Mars. Spike and Jet walk to a video antique shop 

JET: It seems to be something called a videotape. An artifact of the good
old days. She's the one that ran away. She has no right to complain
even if we sell it off.

SPIKE: You think it will sell?

JET: They say he's a maniac when it comes to 20th century images... I'm
sure he'd buy it.

SPIKE: I just don't think this is worth anything.

JET: The real worth of treasures like this can't be determined from the
outside. You may be surprised at how much you can sell it for!

They arrive at the doorstep of the shop. A man watches sits in front of a
monitor contently watching and old television show.

JET: I need to get enough to cover the C.O.D. charges at least.

Jet walks in.

JET: Excuse me!

MAN: QUIET!

The show.

GIRL: Everything about this city is different from Minnesota, where we were
before. Hey, brother, are you sure we can get along well here?

GUY: Mm... To tell the truth, I wasn't so sure that we could. But, I'm sure
we'll be all right. Because I'm here with my twin sister.

GIRL: Thanks, brother.

GUY: Oh, man, I have to work in the morning!

GIRL: Good night, brother.

GUY: Good night!

Closing credits are displayed.

MAN: GOD, that's good! Drama series from the 20th century are so good!

The man stops the tape.

MAN: On the other hand... drama series as of late are so -

JET: I have something you want to watch -

The man stand up and yells at smoking Spike.

MAN: Hey, hey, hey, you can't do that! The cigarette, man, the cigarette!
Don't you know that smoke can totally screw up electrical appliances?
Sheesh, this is why I hate people who don't know -

Spike puts out the cigarette on a VCR. The man screams.

MAN: Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! SHEESH! What the hell do you guys want?!
What do you have against me?!

JET: No grudges, but no gratitude either. I just have something we want you
to buy from us.

MAN: Ah! Is that a Beta cassette!? That's amazing! Where did you get a hold
of this? This is a true find, mister! It's close to a miracle that
this thing exists in one piece!

JET: Beta?

MAN: You don't know what this is? Oh, all right, do you want me to explain?
Back in the 20th century, they didn't use disks like we do to record
movies. They used things called videotapes, which are in cassettes
like this. It's not digital! It's analog! And to top it off, it's
magnetic... Yeah, magnetic! They were recording with electromagnetic
signals! Ain't that amazing? But a disagreement between the companies
who created this technology resulted in two standards, Beta and VHS.
Beta had a small cassette for their day and the playback decks were
compact and didn't take much space. You didn't get that much noise
when using the special replay features like still frame and slow
motion. And, because Beta had high quality images users who were into
good graphics supported it really heavily. But, there begins the
unfortunate history of the Beta tape.

Spike and Jet are extremely bored.

JET: You don't need to tell me.

MAN: This is just the introduction!

JET: I told you what we wanted. So how is it? Are ya gonna buy it?

MAN: Well, that depends on what's on it...

The man puts the tape into a deck. The monitor displays a public park and
forestry. Suddenly there is noise in the picture.

JET: Hey, what's wrong?

MAN: It's so hard to adjust the tracking for these early Beta tapes...

The man turns knobs at the bottom of the tape deck.

MAN: This way? Or this way?

The monitor displays the back of a purple headed girl standing by a beach.
The girl turns around. Suddenly the picture warps.

MAN: It's eating the tape!

Spike starts kicking the tape deck. The man freezes.

JET: It's not getting any better...

Spike completely smashes the deck. The picture goes blank.


At the dog races. Faye watches with excitement.

FAYE: It's coming... It is... It is...

The dogs cross the finish line. Faye wins.

FAYE: I got it! Dogs are better than horses after all!


Back on the Bebop.

SPIKE: Most things get better if I kick 'em...

JET: You just don't know when to quit...

The computer receives a call.

MAN: Dammit, repay me for breaking my deck!

JET: You again...

MAN: You broke someone else's valuable machinery and you're not going to
take responsibility for it?!

JET: And how are you going to take responsibility for our valuable tape?

MAN: Early Beta decks often eat tapes! In any case, I'll have you pay for
the repair costs!

JET: We'll call it even with the cost of the tape!

MAN: WHAT?! Be -

Jet hangs up.

SPIKE: Sheesh...

Ed finds information on her computer.

ED: Hello, Beta deck! There's just one of those. Where is this? The
Underground City Electrical Museum in old Asia?

JET: I'm going to figure out what's on that tape at any cost!

SPIKE: Is it really something worth all the trouble?


At the dog races.

FAYE: It's coming... It's... It's... It's...

Faye wins.

FAYE: YEAH! I got it! Really, I wonder if those guys were sucking up all my
luck all this time.


EYCATCH


The Bebop exits a hyperspace gate to Earth.


Faye calls the Bebop at a noodle restaurant.

FAYE: Ah... Hello. Hello?

She reaches Ed. The reception is bad.

ED: Hey, helllllloooooo... Ah... it's... Faye... Yoohoo...

FAYE: Wait... Hello? What is this, where are you guys?

ED: Earth... Earth! 

FAYE: Earth?! Wait a minute, you guys left me behind to go that far away...

ED: Spike... and Jet...

The connection is lost.


Earth. The Bebop lands. Spike and Jet fly to an old building.

JET: All right, just a little longer.

SPIKE: Is there really one left in a place like this?

JET: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.


In the building. Jet reads a sign by an elevator.

JET: 28th underground floor.

Spike pushes the elevator button. Nothing happens.

JET: It's not moving?

They open the door with a crowbar.

JET: The cable broke, so it's stuck.


Spike and Jet slide down the elevator cable. The car above them suddenly
falls. They quickly dodge and grab pipes in the walls.

The journey to the 28th basement floor become more bizarre and perilous
with each step.

JET: Why are we going through all of this?

SPIKE: It just means that treasure-hunting isn't easy.

JET: Treasure? What was the treasure we were after?

SPIKE: The Tamatebako, was it?

JET: I kinda see why the man turned into an old geezer after opening the
Tamatebako now...

SPIKE: Even if we head back now, we're not gonna be any younger.

JET: This is some Ryuuguujou... Where DID that broad go in the first
place?!


At the dog races.

FAYE: It's coming... It's, it's...

The dogs cross the finish line. Faye loses.

FAYE: Oh, well, nothing I could've done. Races are all luck anyway.


Spike and Jet reach the 28th basement floor.

SPIKE: Is it here?

JET: It's here. All right.

They find a shelf of tape decks.

SPIKE: Is this it?

JET: Yeah, that's gotta be it.

SPIKE: And? Which one are we taking back?

JET: Let's see... Well, bigger is always better, they say.


They return to the Bebop with a tape deck and an old television set. Jet
tries to shove the tape into the deck. It doesn't fit.

SPIKE: What's wrong?

JET: The size...

SPIKE: Isn't it all right?

JET: It's not going in.

SPIKE: Force it in.

JET: But...

Ed pops up.

ED: Ah! That's not it! That's VHS, so ya can't see the tape!


Ed's computer rings with an incoming call. Ein walks to it and answers the
call. It is Faye.

FAYE: Oh, hello, it's me.

Faye's communicator displays Ein. Faye frowns. Ein barks to Faye. Faye's
right eye twitches. Ed goes to the computer.

ED: Ein, who are you talking to? Oh, it's Faye!

FAYE: I'm glad there's an organism there that I can talk to.

ED: What is it?

FAYE: Was there anyone who went there to visit me?

ED: Visitors?

FAYE: Like scary middle-aged guys. You know, guys that scream stuff like:
"Gimme back my money!" or "You're under arrest!"?

ED: Yeah, there was one.

FAYE: Eh? And?

ED: Something about repay him, even with tape munch, munch and grind,
bye-bye!

FAYE: Eh? Okay... Oh, well. Where's Spike and Jet?

ED: Disappointed and zoned out.

FAYE: I see... Hmm... That's how... Oh, well. If they're so lonely without
me, I guess I have no choice. I'm coming back!


A delivery truck with a rabbit painted on it lands on the deck of the
Bebop.

JET: What?! Another package for that broad?! I won't accept it! Take it and
go back!

Spike rips open the package.


The living room.

JET: Shit, why do I have to pay for HER C.O.D.?! And not once, but TWICE!

Spike struggles with the packing.

SPIKE: You sure are persistent.

He uncovers a Beta deck.

ED: A Beta!

SPIKE: We can see the tape with this?

ED: Yeah.

Faye returns.

FAYE: Hey, guys, long time no see.

They stare angrily at Faye.


Ed sets up the television and the deck.

ED: It's done.

JET: Hold up.

Jet turns to Faye.

JET: If you're going to watch pay back the C.O.D. charges. With tax, a 
total of 31,500 Woolongs.

FAYE: Oh, fine.

Faye walks away.


The tape plays. Shots of a 20th century city.

JET: We have something!

ED: Ooooh... what's this?

JET: Shut up and watch.

A bashful teenage Faye and classmates.

FAYE: Um... Everyone decided to send a message to themselves ten years in
the future.

The girls break into laughter.

FAYE: Oh, come on, don't laugh!

A solo close-up shot of Faye. Spike, Jet and Ed are startled.

FAYE: Um... This makes me blush after all! Eh? Something I want to say?
Good morning...

The girls laugh.

FAYE: Oh! Nevermind!

Faye on the Bebop stares wide-eyed at the footage.

The shot changes. Young Faye's bedroom.

FAYE: Good morning, me. Did you sleep well? And did you wake up well? Does
the light and the wind, the air and the smell, all feel brand new? Is
each and every cell in your body awake now? Today, you are who you
are today. You are a newer version of me. Myself ten years from
now... That's so far away for me that I can't even begin to imagine.
Am I alone? Or is there a wonderful person next to me? Well, knowing
me, I'm sure I am troubling a lot of different people. But that's all
right. There's no problem. I will always be cheering you on.

The shot changes. Young Faye in a cheerleading outfit.

FAYE: And now for a big cheer... from the bottom of my heart. Go! Go! Me,
me, me! Do your best, do your best! Me, me, me! Don't lose, don't
lose! Me, me, me!

Faye continues staring at the footage. Tears form in her eyes.

FAYE: I don't know... I can't remember... Is this... me?

The tape pauses on a still image of young Faye.

FAYE: I am no longer here... But I'm here today, and I'll always be
cheering for you right here... Cheering for you, my only self.


SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY


CLOSING CREDITS


COMING EPISODE

SPIKE: You know, I'm starting to get tired of us doing all the previews
like this... Once in a while, can't we have someone else...

Ein barks.

SPIKE: Oh? Oh! You're perfect. All right! Here, you try doing it this time.

Ein continues to bark.

SPIKE: Oh! So THAT'S how it is!

Ein continues to bark.

SPIKE: Wow, this is going to be an interesting episode!

EIN: Next Episode: "Wild Horses."

SPIKE: Hey, it spoke!

Wild Horses

OPENING CREDITS


A desert on Earth. Spike spots a ship take off in the distance and tries to
hitch a ride. Swordfish II is parked beside him.


Session #19
WILD HORSES


In Red Tail, Faye floats by Earth's moon, idle.

FAYE: Really, this just doesn't suit my style to just sit and wait like
this.


The Bebop hides nearby.

JET: We pick our spot, then wait patiently. That is the secret behind
fishing.

FAYE: Did you ever consider that may be this was the WRONG spot?

JET: The bait has no right to complain.

ED: What are you fishing for?

JET: "Starship Pirates." A group that calls themselves pirates.

ED: Pirates?

JET: A group of people that like to attack a ship and rob anything and
everything from them.

ED: Like to rob, rob, drunken slob!

FAYE: Besides, where the hell did Spike go?! He left to overhaul his ship,
and still hasn't -

Ein hangs up on Faye.

JET: Thanks. But Spike... Man... What's he doing now, without giving us a
heads-up?


The desert on Earth. Spike sits in the shade under Swordfish. A truck
pulls up. Spike opens the side door.

SPIKE: You're late, Doohan!

Inside, a young man named Miles is listening to the radio on headphones.

MILES: Yeah! Go, go, go!

SPIKE: Hey...? HEY!

Spike unplugs the headphones.

RADIO: Strike three! Batterout! He just let that one slide by... and that's
the game!

Miles kicks the radio, crushing it.

MILES: Man! Why didn't they just send in a pinch-hitter? Come on,
Eightwood is getting OLD! Don't ya think?

SPIKE: Where's Doohan?

MILES: The old man's kinda busy right now. I'm Miles, his assistant. Nice
to meet ya.


On the road. Swordfish rides in the back.

MILES: Man, they were really great when they won the pennant 14 years ago.
They just kept hittin' the ball one after another, and turned losing
games around! Especially when Randy, Blanket and Hills hit
consecutive homers... I really wish you coulda seen it. And ya
know - Hey, do people often say you're the silent type?

SPIKE: And people often say you talk too much, right?

MILES: Kinda. The... Swordfish, right? The machine back there...

SPIKE: Yeah.

MILES: That's the amazing mono-racer that the old man built, right?

SPIKE: It's just an old machine. I don't want it, but it's a part of me.

MILES: I hear ya... Us Blue Sox fans feel like we fell for some wicked
broad. Really! I can't remember how many times I've thought about
giving up on them!


They enter a junkyard filled with various forms of aircraft. The side of a
building housing an old space shuttle explodes.

MILES: Jesus, not again...


They walk into the building.

MILES: Yo, old man!

The mechanic Doohan walks out to check out Swordfish, the back of his shirt
smoking.

SPIKE: Yo. Long time no see.

DOOHAN: Yeah. Miles, where's the checklist!?

MILES: It's out there! I put it on the ship's body!

SPIKE: He's been fixing that ancient thing?

MILES: I think it's useless. The computer isn't compatible with the mono-
system...

DOOHAN: Miles! Gimme the EV Transmitter, the absorber for the main gear and
the three-eight pneumatic tube!

MILES: A three-eight?! I don't have something that special!

DOOHAN: Order one from Reggie. His place has them!

MILES: Yeah, yeah. You really are some slave driver!

Spike looks onto the old shuttle.

SPIKE: Some hobby!


Alarms sound on the Bebop.

JET: Did we catch it?

In Red Tail, Faye looks around.

FAYE: It wasn't me! Where is it?

JET: It's close! Shit, I used bad bait!

FAYE: Hey!


The pirates, George, Ruth, and Harman, fire a harpoon at truck.

GEORGE: This is a good machine. Attacking blessed people like them and
giving to the poor is human equality. Don't you think so?

RUTH: Heh, heh, I get it. This is what ya call social reform.

They real the truck into their haul.

GEORGE: Yeah. It's only right for us, the poor, to take from them!

Red Tail jets toward them.

HARMAN: Something's coming!

GEORGE: Cops?!

Red Tail stops in front of their truck.

FAYE: Hi. That's enough.

GEOREGE: Bounty hunter...? Herman.

HARMAN: Be a good girl and come here...

Harman readies the harpoon. In Hammerhead, Jet sees it.

JET: Faye, above you!

Faye is harpooned. Red Tail goes berserk.

FAYE: What the..?! Is this a joke?!

Red Tail fires randomly and begins to hit Hammerhead.

FAYE: It's not me!

Harman spots the Bebop.

HARMAN: Ruth! One more behind us! And it's HUGE!

RUTH: I know. What a tattered old ship!

JET: Leave me alone!

They harpoon the Bebop. The Bebop goes berserk.

Ed readies the emergency pilot program. Ein pushes the enter button before
Ed could.

BEBOP: Abnormality found in the mono-system. Booting the emergency pilot
program.

The Red Tail continues to fire randomly.

FAYE: Hey, stop this thing!

JET: Like I know how!

The pirates jet away.


Doohan's office. Spike looks at old photographs on the bulletin board.


The hanger. Doohan tunes up Swordfish.

DOOHAN: Looks like he's taken you on quite a few spins. Cut it!

MILES: The accelerator pump is all worn down.

DOOHAN: I know.

MILES: And the fuel injector doesn't have a silencer on it...

DOOHAN: Don't need one.

MILES: But it's noisy, and it trembles...

DOOHAN: If you put one in, then I can't hear what it's telling me! Just
hurry up and connect the injector.

MILES: First of all, a three-eight isn't popular anymore... Why don't you
switch to the new five-zero?

Spike enters with coffee.

DOOHAN: Miles.

MILES: And if you change the navigation to full-auto then you can glide
along without manual steering...

DOOHAN: Do you want to use a machine, or do you want the machine to use
you? Which is it?

MILES: I wasn't exactly -

DOOHAN: Just go!

Spike picks up a pointy piece.

SPIKE: You haven't changed a bit. At this rate, another assistant is gonna
leave you.

The piece punctures Spike's finger. Doohan smiles.

DOOHAN: And you! The Swordfish wants to run away from you!

SPIKE: I haven't heard that before.

DOOHAN: If you keep being reckless with her, she'll really throw you off
someday!

SPIKE: Unfortunately, I'm not one for delicate controls.

Reggie pulls up in his truck.

REGGIE: Sorry to keep you waiting! I got something you don't see often...
A three-eight pneumatic tube!


Spike calls Bebop.

FAYE: Yes, hello? Oh, it's you, Missing Man. Where are you right now?

SPIKE: I'm still with Doohan. How's Jet?

FAYE: He seems rather busy right now... Saying something about some
bacteria...

SPIKE: Bacteria?!

JET: A virus! We got a computer virus!

FAYE: Same difference.

JET: Starting with the mono-system, orbit calculator, flight path selector,
engine regulator, communications circuit... they're all shot.

SPIKE: I don't get it. Gimme a simple explanation.

ED: The computer broke and we're just drifting along!

SPIKE: Well, I understood that.

REGGIE: How about it? It's the newest one. You haven't seen one floating
around anywhere else, right?

DOOHAN: A mono-computer...?

REGGIE: How about it? 150K, no, 100K.

DOOHAN: A bargain, huh? When it's sold THAT cheap, you lose money even on
salvage.

Spike continues to talk on his communicator.

SPIKE: So, who did it?

DOOHAN: Where did you get this?

SPIKE: A truck? Any features?

REGGIE: A penguin -

FAYE: - logo on -

SPIKE & DOOHAN: - the delivery truck?!

Spike and Doohan look at each other.


EYECATCH


Spike returns to the Bebop.

JET: Are you sure about the info?

SPIKE: Yeah. They apparently were dealing at the Orbit Drive-in.

JET: I see... nobody would be suspicious of a delivery truck wandering
about.

SPIKE: And how are we going to counter the hacks?

JET: Don't get harpooned!

Silence.

SPIKE: And?

FAYE: That's IT?!

Jet is furious.

JET: They laughed this ship off as "tattered!" And they made that mess out
of my Hammerhead! Unlike SOMEONE I know, I always pay back what I owe.

FAYE: What a wonderful principle.

SPIKE: I'm really not up for this...

Jet smiles.

JET: I have an invoice from Doohan here.


They take off from Earth.

JET: Because they're PHYSICALLY sending the virus they haven't developed a
vaccine for it. That is where this secret weapon of ours come in.

Jet puts down a communicator.

FAYE: What? That's just our normal communicator.

JET: If you get infected by the virus, cut off the entire mono-system.
Then, all navigation and communication will go down. As I said, I will
navigate you with this. Because this is set to the frequency for an
old communications satellite it has nothing to do with the mono-
system.


Spike sets up the communicator on Swordfish.

RADIO: Oh, another run scored against the Blue Sox!

SPIKE: That's some secret weapon...

Spike takes off.


Doohan's hanger. Miles listens to the Blue Sox game. Doohan hears it and
glares at Miles.

The Drive-In. Swordfish and Red Tail stop before two trucks with penguins
painted on them.

SPIKE: It was a penguin, right?

FAYE: Yeah. A purple penguin.

JET: There are two of them? Wait a minute, it might be a real courier
service. It's a matter of how to figure out if they are legit...

FAYE: That's easy. We fire a shot, and the one that runs is the one we
want.

SPIKE: This is the first time I agree with you on something...

JET: Y-You guys - !

They fire at the trucks.

JET: What are you gonna do if they're both real?!

Both flee.

SPIKE: They both ran?

FAYE: We didn't consider that option...

SPIKE: I'm trusting you with that one!

FAYE: I have to pay them back for yesterday, too.

Faye destroys the booster engines of one of the trucks. The truck stops.
Faye stops in front of them.

TRUCKER A: Forgive us!

TRUCKER B: W-We'll pay the parking fee!

Faye's right eye twitches.


Spike continues chasing the other truck.

SPIKE: This way?!

JET: Spike! Draw them out!


Doohan's hanger. Miles overhears Spike and Jet's communication on the
radio.

JET: It'll be a mess if they let the virus go in there!

SPIKE: I know!


Earth space. Spike continues chasing the pirates.

SPIKE: So let's see what ya got...

GEORGE: He's here.

HARMAN: Waste of time.

Spike hides under the haul and fires at the harpoon.

HARMAN: He's after the arm...

GEORGE: He's not taking us seriously! Ruth!

RUTH: Ready to go anytime.

GEORGE: Take that!

George releases the haul. Behind the truck are dozens of harpoon guns.

RUTH: Welcome...

Spike dodges them.

SPIKE: Excellent!

Harman locks on to Spike.

HARMAN: Bingo!

Spike barely dodges Harman's harpoon shot.

RUTH: He's holding up pretty well.

Spike is finally hit by a harpoon.

JET: Cut off the mono-system!

SPIKE: I'm doing it!

RUTH: That idiot cut off his mono-system!

HARMAN: Hey... George...

RUTH: And he's in Earth's gravitational field...

The pirates truck are hit by a harpoon.


Doohan's office. Miles runs in with the radio.

MILES: Old man! Here, here!

They overhear Spike and Jet's communication.

MILES: This is pretty bad!

JET: Align the D7. Ya did it before, right?

SPIKE: Like I remember!


Earth space. The pirates are being pulled into Earth's atmosphere.

GEORGE: No good... There's nothing we can do...

HARMAN: You idiot! Hurry up and do something about this!

GEORGE: Dammit... Move! MOVE!

RUTH: Falling... We're falling!


Spike rewires Swordfish.

JET: Spike, I'll be right there. I'm calculating an interception course.
Until then, keep control manually somehow. Even if everything was
normal, it'd be tough to get outta here.

SPIKE: I can see that. And I just had it overhauled...

Meteors crash into Swordfish.

SPIKE: Oh well. Whatever happens, happens.

Spike dodges meteors.

JET: Spike, above you.

Spike sees the Bebop above him.

SPIKE: Your tattered ship looks like a goddess!

The pirates' truck crashes into a meteor and explodes, harpoons fly upward.

SPIKE: Shit, the virus...

Spike flies low and uses Swordfish to block the harpoons from hitting the
Bebop.

JET: Spike!

SPIKE: I'm still alive!

JET: We have to start over!


Doohan's hanger.

MILES: No way! Old man, ya gotta be kidding! Are you really gonna move this
ancient piece of -

Miles laughs.

DOOHAN: Do you think I'd do this as a joke? Don't just stand there! Hurry
up and get me some fuel!

MILES: All right!


Earth space. Swordfish slowly falls into Earth's atmosphere.

JET: Spike, can you hear me? I got a calculation. It'll take another 7
hours for us to rendezvous.

SPIKE: Come on, you're joking, right?

JET: We're too close to Earth. The orbital paths I can take are limited!

SPIKE: Isn't there a way for you to just swing on by?

JET: If I plunge in at this angle, both the Bebop and the Swordfish will
burn to nothing!

Swordfish's underside begins to burn.

SPIKE: Jet... I have some booze hidden behind the fridge. Feel free to
drink some.

JET: Something wrong?!

SPIKE: I'm outta gas. Nothing I can do now.

Doohan communicates to Spike through the radio.

DOOHAN: How about I go there and tow you back, in exchange for that booze?
I heard the conversation. Give me the Swordfish's coordinates.

SPIKE: Doohan?! How the hell do you - ?!


Doohan's hanger. Doohan prepares to launch the old space shuttle.

DOOHAN: Spike, I don't care how ya do it, but slow down using an air-brake.

SPIKE: Slow down?

DOOHAN: If you slow down within Earth's atmosphere the gravitational pull
will accelerate you instead which will give you enough speed to
escape. However, you have to maintain the ship at a certain angle.
Too far either way, and you'll be thrown out to the other end of
the universe.

SPIKE: Unfortunately, I'm not one for delicate controls.

DOOHAN: Spike... I know you can do it. I didn't give you the Swordfish for
nothing.

SPIKE: Don't you start crashing, either!


In the shuttle.

MILES: Maximum propulsion.

DOOHAN: You didn't have to force yourself to come with me.

MILES: You know how Blue Sox fans love to party!

DOOHAN: Let's go!

MILES: All right!

The shuttle takes off.

MILES: We're flying... We're REALLY flying!


Earth Space.

JET: Lower the nose by 0.6 degrees.


Spike lowers too far.

JET: You're in too deep! Spike, you'll burn to a crisp!

Spike spots Doohan's shuttle. The back of the shuttle opens up.

DOOHAN: This is the last chance!

Spike breaks off Swordfish's wings and falls into the shuttle.

MILES: It went in! It went in! That was perfect!

SPIKE: Doohan, you saved me.

DOOHAN: Not quite. Most of the heat-resistant tiles have peeled off. The
temperature is rising...

MILES: T-The landing gear isn't coming down either!

DOOHAN: Oh yeah, and the #2 nozzle won't work either.

MILES: WHAT!? Is that for real? What are we gonna do? We can't land without
them!

SPIKE: Oh well... Whatever happens, happens.

MILES: I KNEW I shouldn't have come up here! I'm still too young to die!


Sometime later. Doohan's office. A photograph of Doohan, Miles and Spike is
posted on the bulletin board. Behind them is the remains of the space
shuttle.

Pierrot Le Fou

OPENING CREDITS


A dark night. A city on Mars. From the sky, a round man in a top hat with
a cane lands in front of an black car surrounded by bodyguards protecting a
man in a suit. The man in the top hat is known by some as Tongpu, a
dreadful nightmare.

TONGPU: Hello, gentlemen. I have come to take your lives.


Session #20
PIERROT LE FOU


A bar called "C'est la vie." Spike wins at a game of billiards.

Tongpu quickly kills the guards and the man they were guarding. Spike
unsuspectingly enters the scene. Tongpu turns around and greets him.

TONGPU: Hello, boy.

He fires at Spike. Spike dodges and returns fire. His bullets bounce off
Tongpu. Tongpu floats to Spike. Spike throws punches and Tongpu dodges
them. He kicks Spike several times and points his gun at him with a grin. A
cat meows on a fire escape. Tongpu goes berserk and fires at the cat. Spike
finds a drum of fuel, rolls it to Tongpu and fires. He runs from the
explosion. Tongpu emerges unscathed and throws a knife into Spike's
shoulder. He fires a rocket at Spike. Spike dodges and falls into a river.
Tongpu disappears.


Mars in the morning. Under a billboard.

BOB: Your partner sure is unlucky, Jet.

JET: Well, he wasn't all that lucky to begin with...

BOB: This case is especially bad. It would be better to not get yourselves
involved in this one.

JET: I don't care, just answer me. Now.

BOB: I'm telling you this for your own sake, and if you get too involved in
this, I'm gonna get in trouble too.

JET: You know, Bob... You're the only person I can rely on right now. I'll
make sure it won't be bad for you. So -

BOB: Don't you say that every time? Really... you always have been a guy
that likes to get into trouble... All right, this is only a rumor,
but... have you heard of the name "Mad Pierrot?"


The Bebop living room. Spike is bandaged head to toe on the couch.

FAYE: There he is... the rumored mummy. So, I heard you got beaten up by
some weird guy?

Spike mumbles.

FAYE: I recall you were sleeping like this once before. You really haven't
shown any improvement... Oh well, it doesn't have anything to do with
me.

Spike mumbles.

FAYE: Don't you end up in situations like that because you never behave?
Well, I have nothing to do with it.

Spike mumbles.

FAYE: So, since I have nothing to do with it, if you'll excuse me... Take
care.


Under the billboard.

BOB: The victim was a high-ranking guy from the ISSP. He was the seventh
victim. What did you say? Can't blame ya. This is top secret.
Apparently those higher-ups don't want the world to find out about
this.

JET: Why?

BOB: Your partner is in deep trouble. The guy is a perfect killing machine.
They say that nobody who has seen his face has made it out alive...
Even those lucky enough to escape'll be tracked down to the ends of
the world and they always wind up dead. They say he appears with a
smile, and he leaves with a smile... Yeah, he is the mysterious
assassin known as Mad Pierrot... Tongpu.


EYECATCH


Ed computer receives e-mail. Ein hears ringing and alerts Ed. Ed balances
her computer on her head and walks to Faye with the messege.

ED: Faye-Faye! Puff, puff!. Faye-Faye! Puff, puff! Faye-Faye...

FAYE: Hey, you, can you stop saying my name twice like that?

ED: Faye-Faye, a weird mail came, came. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

FAYE: And I woulda been done if I had a little more time...

Ed dances around.

FAYE: I can't read it!

Faye grabs her head and holds it still. She reads the messege.

FAYE: "Hello, boy. I'll invite you to a wonderful party..." Wait, this
is... Listen, keep the fact that this mail came a secret from Spike.

ED: Secret? Why? Why secret?

FAYE: If we don't, that idiot -

Spike is behind her still bandaged.

SPIKE: - will run out to meet him?

ED: It's a secret, secret mail!

SPIKE: Space Land? Pretty considerate of him to hold the party there.

FAYE: You're gonna go like that? Well, it would be perfect if it was a
masquerade.

SPIKE: Maybe this one really will be the end of me...

Faye stares at him silently.

SPIKE: Just kidding! Would you come rescue me if l said that?

FAYE: Idiot.

ED: Idiot, idiot, idiot!


Spike takes off in Swordfish.


Jet returns to Bebop.

JET: Hey... Oh, it's you, Ed. Where's Spike?

ED: He went somewhere.

JET: What? Not that this is anything new... That idiot...

ED: Idiot, idiot?

JET: Ed, I have a favor to ask.

ED: What, what?


A closed theme park in a crator on Mars. Space Land. Spike lands and hops
out of Swordfish. He walks through the park in the darkness. Suddenly a
light blazes on and he is greeted by Tongpu.

TONGPU: Hello! Welcome!

SPIKE: Yo...

Tongpu laughs maniacally.

TONGPU: Let's party!

The entire theme park lights up. Pierrot and Spike exchange gunfire. Spike
enters the back of a ride. A projected cartoon character appears.

PROJECTION: You can't enter here! It's dangerous in here! Let's play
outside! It's dangerous in here! Let's play outside!

SPIKE: Shut up!

PROJECTION: It's dangerous in here! Let's play outside! It's dangerous in
here!

A fast penguin car slides down toward Spike.

PROJECTION: It's dangerous in here! Let's play outside!

Tongpu in a penguin car slides past Spike.

TONGPU: Hi!

Tongpu fires a rocket at Spike.


The Bebop.

JET: All right, Ed... First, enter the ISSP's main computer, and look for
section 13.

Ed searches on the internet.

ED: Aye, aye!

JET: That's... the section that doesn't exist to the general public. It's a
pretty tall order... Can you do it?

ED: Yup!


Space land. Spike hides behind a pillar. He hears Tongpu's laughter. He
spots him and fires, the bullets bounce off. A stuffed robot cartoon
character walks toward Spike.

ROBOT: Hello!

Spike destroys it.


The Bebop.

ED: Found it!

JET: After you open it, find the file with the codename "Tongpu."

ED: Yup!


Space Land. A chain of explosions propel Spike to a roller coaster. Tongpu
catches Spike with a whip. Tongpu throws an explosive at Spike. Spike
falls from the roller coaster and into a body of water.


The Bebop. Ed hacks into the file.

ED: Peek-a-BOO!

A recording of experiments performed on Tongpu in a white room are shown. A
cat with two different-colored eyes sits at the window of the room.

RECORDING: ISSP Assassination Ability Improvement Experiment. Experiment
sample chart number 46. Codename: Tongpu. Confirmed a strong
regression of the mind during the experiment. Experiment was
canceled. Sample to be permanently kept in a quarantine
facility.

JET: In the beginning, he escaped from the facilities to seek revenge but
now he seems to be enjoying the actual act of killing. His mind must
be continuing to regress... So he's like a child with superhuman
fighting abilities. Really... There is nothing as pure and cruel as
children...


Spike emerges from the water. Tongpu greets him.

TONGPU: It's show time!

Tongpu fires rockets at Spike. Spike dodges them. Suddenly Red Tail enters
the scene. Faye fires a rocket at Tongpu.

SPIKE: That was unnecessary!

Tongpu dodges, and shoots down Red Tail. The explosion launches Spike
crashing into a gift shop window. A robot cartoon character approaches
Faye.

ROBOT: Hello, hello, hello, hello... 

FAYE: Hello... 

Tongpu approaches Spike. A small meowing toy cat falls from the display.
Tongpu goes berserk, recalling the cat with two different-colored eyes and
the experiments. Tongpu shoots the cat to bits. Spike runs onto the main
road firing at Tongpu. Tongpu follows and shoots Spike's gun out of his
hand. A parade of cartoon characters is about to run between them. Spike
reaches into his back pocket and pulls a small knife. A beam of light from
the parade crosses Spike's eyes. Tongpu sees Spike's eyes are different
colors and pauses in fear. Spike tosses the knife and it hits Tongpu's
right thigh. He collapses and writhes in pain, crying. The parade crosses.

TONGPU: T-That hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It HURTS! Hurts... Mommy, it
hurts! MOMMY! It hurts... Mommy!

A giant robotic stuffed animal crushes Tongpu under its foot. Spike
watches. Suddenly he receives a call.

JET: Spike! All right, we figured out what he is! He is -

SPIKE: No... I don't need it anymore... It all ended just now...

FAYE: So that's what it was!

�ĝğďŕ�sil - September 21, 2005 03:16 AM (GMT)
Boogie-Woogie Feng-Shui

OPENING CREDITS


Jet narrates.

JET: This strange story began on a blistering hot day. I had received an
unexpected mail from an old acquaintance of mine but the message was
just this: "Seek the sacred beast from Anzan. I am at the meeting
place of the four gods." 


Session #21
BOOGIE-WOOGIE FENG-SHUI


Jet continues narrating.

JET: Pao, the sender of the message, was an acquaintance of mine but it
didn't mean that we kept in touch all that well. I grew suspicious,
and started to research Pao's current whereabouts. They say that Pao
is one of the three greatest Feng Shui masters here on Mars... But
when I found his whereabouts, he had already left this world...


A cemetery on Mars. Jet stands before Pao's gravestone.

JET: Are you sure you weren't the one that sent me this mail?

A girl, Pao's daughter, Meifa, rises from behind the stone.

MEIFA: The one who visits from the inauspicious back door... Receive the
word from the heavens, and lead me to the sun stone... So the pa-kua
divination is true!

She spots two thugs with guns behind Jet.

MEIFA: Look out!

She pushes Jet out of the way of gunfire. The shots hit Pao's gravestone.

THUG A: Where are you shooting?!

They hide behind another gravestone.

JET: They sure are disrespectful fellows.

Meifa consults her luo-pan.

MEIFA: The escape route!

She stand up, and grabs Jet by the hand and runs. The thugs shoot at them
and miss.

THUG A: Idiot!

THUG B: Shit!

They chase after Jet and Meifa.

Jet and Meifa jump into a wooded section. They reach the end, under them is
a strip of road. Meifa spots a two-story bus.

MEIFA: Escape route!

They hop on. The thugs chase them in a car. Meifa spots a river next to
them.

MEIFA: Chi of Earth!

JET: Hey!

They jump in and resurface.

MEIFA: That was really close! I'm glad we're safe.

Jet stares at her, confused.


The Bebop parked on the river. Spike spots Faye, Ed and Ein from the
shadows of the hallway, spying on Jet and Meifa in the living room.

SPIKE: What are you doing?

FAYE: Hey, over there... Who is that? I wonder if she's a new girlfriend.

SPIKE: For that, she's rather young.

ED: Weird one, hot dog bun, loved one!

FAYE: Maybe she's his secret love child?

SPIKE: For that, she's rather old.

ED: Child, mild, wild!

Jet and Meifa drink tea in the living room.

JET: But I'm surprised. I wasn't expecting Pao's daughter to be this old
already. You probably don't remember but I met you once when you were
this little.

MEIFA: How do you know my father?

JET: How? Just an acquaintance. It's been 10 years already. But your father
sure was unlucky to be in a traffic accident...

MEIFA: On the way to Jupiter, there was a sudden fluctuation in
hyperspace...

Ed walks by with a plate of Piyokos.

ED: Here you go.

MEIFA: Thank you.

ED: Are you the "girlfriend?"

Jet spits out his tea.

ED: Are you the "secret love child?"

Jet looks around and spots Spike, Faye and Ein in the hallway. They
disband.

ED: Rejected!

Ed runs off.

MEIFA: Mr. Jet, why were you at the graveyard? Nobody outside the family
knows he got into an accident...

Jet hands her a print out of the messege. Meifa reads it.

MEIFA: "Seek the sacred beast from Anzan. I am at the meeting place of the
four gods." This is...?

JET: Pao sent me this.

MEIFA: When?

JET: Three days ago.

MEIFA: Right before the accident... Please! Can you help me?! I'm sure this
is the whereabouts of the sun stone!

JET: Sun stone?

MEIFA: The direction, day, and time you arrived was the best combination
for Feng Shui! Especially when you're searching for something!

JET: I-It was?

MEIFA: It was! Please, Mr. Jet!


The streets of Mars. One of the thugs from before talk to their boss on his
communicator.

THUG B: Yes. About that, we will have it soon. Yes, I understand.

He hangs up.

THUG A: How was the boss feeling?

THUG B: Well...

THUG A: There's no way it could be good.

THUG B: Of course not...

THUG A: Let's go!

They hop into their car.


Jet and Meifa seek clues on the streets. Jet narrates.

JET: I didn't have any particular favors to repay to Pao or this girl but I
decided to help them for now. There were too many things that made me
suspicious to leave it alone. Why did Pao send me mail right before
his death? What do those words mean? Who were those guys that attacked
us? And there was something about this girl named Meifa as well...


They sit at a park on the roof of a skyscraper, eating ice cream in cones.

MEIFA: This universe is made of three different Chis. One is the Chi of
Heaven, the energy that comes from the Sun. One is the Chi of Earth,
the energy that comes from a planet's surface. And lastly Chi of
Magnetism, the Chi that organisms like ourselves produce.

JET: Chi from organisms?

MEIFA: The human body always produces a magnetic field. That magnetic field
and the magnetic field of the Earth react to one another to create
energy. Universal Feng-Shui is a method that reads the energies of
nature such as this to use them in everyday life.

Jet notices melted ice cream trickling from Meifa's cone to the back of her
hand.

JET: Ice cream.

Meifa quickly licks the ice cream from the back of her hand.

JET: Universal Feng-Shui... It's not the same thing as fortune-telling?

MEIFA: Other fortune-telling methods only predict or prognosticate.
However, Universal Feng Shui has the power to make the bad into the
good. For example, if you were a Feng Shui master as powerful as my
father -

Meifa is stops in the middle of her sentence.

JET: What's wrong?

MEIFA: I just realized that I never spent time like this with my father...

JET: Hey, now. Let me point out that I'm not that old. If anything, I would
be a boyfriend... No, wait, that would be bad. W-What am I saying? At
least I can be an elder brother or something...

Meifa notices melted ice cream trickling from Jet's cone to the back of his
hand.

MEIFA: Ice cream...

Jet is confused.

MEIFA: ICE cream.

Jet quickly licks the ice cream from the back of his hand.

MEIFA: Let's go, Mr. Jet!


Atop a tall building. Meifa identifies landmarks.

MEIFA: I believe that "Anzan" refers to here. The Mountain Hotel
Building...

She points to a blue-colored train.

MEIFA: There! Seiryu! (Blue Dragon)

She looks over to a white-colored building complex.

MEIFA: Byakko! (White Tiger)

She looks over to a black-colored dome.

MEIFA: Genbu! (Black Turtle)

She looks over to a set of red-colored mountains.

MEIFA: Suzaku! (Scarlet Phoenix)

JET: Hey...

MEIFA: I know, the cross-zenith method!

She consults her luo-pan.

MEIFA: The sun stone is here!

JET: Are you sure...?


EYECATCH


The thugs sit in their car and spot Jet and Meifa.

THUG B: There they are. They're right over there.

THUG A: All right.

Meifa's luo-pan leads them to the stone, stuck in a lion-head display. She
plucks it out.

MEIFA: I finally found it... This must be the sun stone.

JET: This thing?

Jet spots the thugs' car. They takes Meifa by forearm and walks into a
beverage store.

MEIFA: Mr. Jet?

The thugs get out of their car. A group of kids kicking a ball run toward
them. One of the thugs kicks the ball away.

THUG B: Outta the way.

KIDS: What are you doing?

They run after the ball.


In the beverage store.

JET: One bottle of lao-chu. I don't need a glass.

The thugs enter the store. Jet hits them with the bottle. Meifa leaps on
top of one of them and beats him on the chest.

MEIFA: Take that!

Jet pours the lao-chu on one of them and grabs him.

JET: Hey, who are you guys?

THUG B: Heh, you think we would tell you that easily - ?

Jet puts him in a sleeper hold.

THUG B: W-We're from the Blue Snake...

JET: So you ARE from a syndicate... Why are you following us around?

THUG B: I-I couldn't tell you that even if you killed me -

Jet tightens his hold.

THUG B: I-It was because we couldn't get Pao... So they told us to get the
recipient of his mail... I-I'm telling the truth! We're on the low
end so we don't know any more than that!

JET: I'm sure.

Jet breaks his neck.

MEIFA: Mr. Jet... My father... is alive?


Meifa and Jet walk back to the Bebop. Jet narrates.

JET: Pao's words showed where this stone was. Does that mean Pao is still
alive somewhere? Did he want me to find this stone and do something
with it? It feels like I created more mysteries instead of solving
them. For now, I decided to check out this stone, which was our only
clue.


On the Bebop. Jet analyzes the stone with the computer.

JET: So this is a piece of the moon from that Gate accident 50 years ago.

MEIFA: We Feng-Shui masters call it the sun stone. It's absorbed the
fluctuations in time and space... and conceals a tremendous amount
of energy.

Spike and Faye, each smoking a cigarette joins the conversation.

SPIKE: I can only think of it as a plain old rock...

FAYE: So, how much would it be if we sold it?

Meifa coughs on the smoke.

JET: Hey, guys, if you're gonna smoke, go smoke outside.

FAYE: What? You always smoke in here too!

JET: I'm turning this into a non-smoking area starting today.

SPIKE: Hey, now, you're kidding, right?

JET: This ship is MY ship, remember?


Spike and Faye smoke on the deck.


Back in the living room.

JET: So, what are you gonna do with this stone?

MEIFA: I... have no idea. I don't know what my father is thinking...

Ein grabs the stone in his mouth.

JET: Oh, hey, wait!

Ein runs to the luo-pan.

JET: Ein! Wait!

The lup-pan moves.

MEIFA: The luo-pan...

JET: What?

MEIFA: That can't be... I took the magnet off...

The luo-pan stops, pointing at a specific direction.

MEIFA: I see... I get it now... So that's it! THAT'S IT!


The Bebop takes off into space.

The control room.

MEIFA: If I remember correctly, my father owned a sun stone as well. I'm
sure that the two stones are resonating to show me the
whereabouts of my father.

JET: And that's why Pao made you look for this stone...

MEIFA: But... I don't know why my father sent the mail to you, Mr. Jet and
not to me...


Ed examines the chemical composition of the stone.


The kitchen.

FAYE: What do you think?

SPIKE: They make a good couple.

FAYE: It's a dangerous combination.

SPIKE: What is?

FAYE: The more righteous a guy was in his youth the more likely he's gonna
fall for a young girl later in life.

SPIKE: Is that so?

FAYE: Really... Guys are so clueless.


The control room.

MEIFA: My father was one that believed in Universal Feng-Shui, but not
other people... So my mother left the house, and took me along. That
was seven years ago... I'm sure my father was able to find our
whereabouts easily. But he never even tried to look for us...

JET: I'm sure there was a reason behind it.

MEIFA: Why was my father targeted by those men? Was it because he was
friends with bad people? Please, tell me the truth! Who my father
really was...

JET: Pao... was the consultant for a syndicate. That's the truth. Pao had
leaked information to me about the syndicate, back when I was a
detective. Pao already wanted out of the syndicate back then. However,
it's impossible for someone who knows important syndicate secrets to
ever leave the group. I'm sure Pao was afraid that more bad things
would happen to his family. Well, I'm sure you can confirm it all when
you see him.


The Bebop enters a hyperspace gate. Ed continues to examine the hyperspace
gate.

MEIFA: Here! Around here...

FAYE: There isn't anything here.

JET: How about the radar?

SPIKE: No response.

MEIFA: That can't be... I'm sure this is the place...

The radar picks up a signal.

SPIKE: Hmm? Wait... Hold on...

A laser is fired at the Bebop.

SPIKE: Do we have guests?

JET: They sure are persistent. Spike, Faye, please take care of them!

FAYE: Aren't they YOUR guests?

JET: Help me out if you don't wanna die with this ship!


Swordfish and Red Tail take off into the gate.

FAYE: What rotten luck of the draw.

SPIKE: Sometimes it's good to act without asking "What's in it for me?"
We're fairies who are going to grant the princess' wish.

FAYE: We are?

Several fighters are dispatched.

SPIKE: Unmanned fighters...? So these would be the seven dwarves...

They fire lasers toward the Bebop.

JET: Shit! They're trying to scare us!

Ed floats into the control room.

ED: I got it!

Spike and Faye gun down fighters.

JET: Spike! Come back here!

SPIKE: What?!

JET: Apparently, if we apply lots of energy to that stone we can draw out
all the forces trapped inside it.

SPIKE: And what are we going to do?

JET: This is an all-or-nothing plan, but -

FAYE: I don't care what it is, just hurry!


The bathroom. Ed puts the rock into the toilet bowl.

ED: I put it in!

JET: All right!

Jet releases it into the hyperspace.


JET: Blast this rock with your plasma cannon.

SPIKE: What a great plan this is...

Spike shoots it with the cannon and a large hole in hyperspace opens up. A
ship is trapped inside.


On the Bebop. A call from Pao is received.

PAO: Looks like you made it in time, Jet...

JET: Pao! You're...

PAO: Meifa... It's been a while.

JET: Pao, you're in unstable territory. I can't approach any closer than
this.

PAO: I know... There isn't any oxygen left in here anyway. I sent you that
mail because I wanted you to bring my daughter here...

JET: So you're trying to tell me that you used Feng Shui to bring us here?!

PAO: Yeah...

JET: That's not true, Pao. This wasn't your doing. Meifa is here now
because she WANTED to come here.


PAO: You might be right. Perhaps I was being too conceited... Meifa... it's
wonderful to see you one last time...

MEIFA: I hated you all this time... I despised you all this time... But...

The connection is lost.

MEIFA: Papa...

Meifa sheds tears. The hole closes up. Jet narrates.

JET: Now, I don't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing that we took
her along. In any case, this was how this strange case ended. She went
back to Mars. And the smoking ban was lifted from the living quarters.
Once again, unchanging daily life has returned, just as it was before.
One thing that has changed, though: I no longer read the fortune-
telling pages in magazines.

A shopping center. A serial bomber by the name of Teddy Bomber (TB) sets up
a teddy bear bomb at the middle section of the two buildings.


He laughs out loud on an escalator. From behind, Spike puts the bear on his
shoulder.

SPIKE: You forgot something.

TB: A-As you can see, I'm just some old man. Unfortunately, I don't have
any children, either...

SPIKE: I never said it was yours.

TB: Oh, was it a customer's? I will hold it, then -

TB reaches for it. Spike puts the bear on the hand rest of opposite
escalator.

SPIKE: How about it? Wanna go somewhere?

SPIKE: It's a little to early to go to bed...

TB: I'm an early riser... I sleep early.

SPIKE: If you want a prim and proper life, I have just the place for you. A
hotel where you get three meals and a bodyguard, all for free.

TB: I'm sure that's impossible without a reservation.

Spike smiles.

SPIKE: I'm talking about Hotel PRISON, Teddy Bomber.

TB: I'd rather not, Spike Spiegel.

SPIKE: Oh, you know me?

TB: It's a popular story among criminals that we never want to be caught by
you, or by Andy.

SPIKE: Andy?

TB: I will fulfill my objective!

TB ducks in a corner and pushes the button. Nothing happens.

SPIKE: It won't blow up. I took out the ignition pin.

Spike gives him a beating.

SPIKE: Three million Woolongs, graciously accepted.

TB: That's not the only bear.

TB rolls up his sleeve to reveal several more detonators.

SPIKE: You'll die, too.

TB: I love them to death.

SPIKE: Why do you want to blow stuff up so much?

TB: Ya wanna know? I am giving a warning. I am ringing a bell of warning!
All right, be mindful of what I say!

Whistling. Suddenly a horse and a rider crash through the glass window. It
is a man dressed in the guise of an old-fashioned cowboy, Andy.

TB: Andy!

SPIKE: Andy?

ANDY: Call me Wyatt Earp.

Andy points a pistol at Spike.

ANDY: YOU! Teddy Bomber, serial bomber!

SPIKE: ME?!

ANDY: The fact that you'd plant a bomb here today was easy for ME to figure
out after calculating YOUR criminal cycles.

SPIKE: You don't think that's him?

ANDY: He's a security guard!

SPIKE: Just look at his face!

ANDY: In this day and age, a face means nothing.

SPIKE: Then what is the basis of your theory?!

ANDY: That is... my gut instinct. Yes, INSPIRATION!

TB escapes. Spike chases after him.

SPIKE: Hey, wait!

ANDY: WAIT!

Andy lassos Spike by the neck and Spike falls flat on the floor. Outside,
TB detonates a bear bomb. The middle section collapses.

ANDY: OH, SHIT!

SPIKE: That's why I said Teddy Bomber was THAT guy, you idiot!

ANDY: DANGEROUS!

Andy rides outside, trampling Spike.

ANDY: That was a close one. Giddy up!

Andy rides away.


Session #22
COWBOY FUNK


The Bebop living room.

JET: A horse?

SPIKE: Yeah, a horse.

FAYE: A horse, huh...? I thought something was fishy when you said you
would nab that guy as part of your for aging trip.

SPIKE: What do you mean by that?

FAYE: You used up the food money for all four of us, didn't you?

SPIKE: Oh, come on...

FAYE: What did you use it on?

SPIKE: If you think I'm lying, explain THIS on my back!

Spike points to hoof marks on his back.

JET: All right, I hear ya. The horse I can believe.

FAYE: You can?

JET: But you have to be more creative than a cowboy in a cowboy outfit.

FAYE: Is that the problem?

JET: Now if he was dressed like a samurai -

FAYE: - that would be more plausible.

Jet and Faye laugh. Ed finds data on Andy from the internet.

ED: Here he is, little Andy! Little Andy is a guy in the YMCA!

SPIKE: A Christian?

ED: Nope. Young Men's Cowboy Association!

FAYE: Oh? Such a thing exists?

ED: But he got kicked out soon after joining.

JET: The reason?

ED: Because he caused others trouble!

SPIKE: Of course!

JET: Andy von de Oniyate, the noble son of Oniyate Ranch.

FAYE: Hey, he's pretty cute.

ED: 123 cases of property damage. 89 cases of destruction of public
property. Many, many people injured.

FAYE: A good match for SOMEONE we know.

SPIKE: I told you he existed!

JET: All right, I hear ya.


A masquerade at the top floor of a tall skyscraper. Spike wears an ornate
mask. Jet is dressed as a hippie. Faye is in a full gown.


SPIKE: Any reactions?

JET: None yet. However, we can't let it explode with all these people
around.

SPIKE: His only target is the building. He's not one for murder.

JET: You think we can trust him?

SPIKE: Guys like him are often concerned with their sense of style.

JET: Well, this is the perfect party to hide yourself...


Faye flirts with a waiter.

FAYE: Did you know that a serial bomber is gonna come here?

WAITER: To tell the truth, I didn't know.

FAYE: Well, he's coming.


Jet spots TB in a teddy bear suit.

JET: Hey! The world is about LOVE AND PEACE!

SPIKE: Yo.

TB: H-How did you know it was me?

JET: This lead the way to its papa.

SPIKE: I think I woulda known in either case.

TB: You guys just don't quit, do you?

SPIKE: Speak for yourself.

JET: Why do you want to blow things up so much?

TB: Ya wanna know? I am giving out a warning. Listen, in this world the
root of all evil -

TB is interrupted by whistling. On a horse, Andy enters from an elevator.

FAYE: A horse...

JET: A cowboy...

Andy points a pistol at Jet.

ANDY: HEY, YOU! Teddy Bomber!

JET: M-Me!?

SPIKE: See, I told you.

Andy points another pistol at Spike.

ANDY: Or is it you over there?

SPIKE: Do you have NO memory? We met just yesterday!

ANDY: I have no recollection.

SPIKE: YOU!

HOST: Um, sir, your horse is an inconvenience. It's proving rather
troublesome for our other guests...

ANDY: OH! MY beloved steed Onyx is no ordinary horse! At times, she sets my
troubled mind at ease; at others she is my chess partner.

SPIKE: Like horses play chess!

JET: It doesn't matter either way...

TB in enraged.

TB: I detest... being ignored!

He detonates the bombs and rushes into an elevator.

Spike takes to the emergency staircase.

SPIKE: What happened to his sense of style?!

Everyone rushes into elevators. Jet is caught in the crowd.

JET: Calm down! I'm telling you to calm down! Love and peace, man!


Faye and Andy on his horse ride down in an elevator.

FAYE: Such a lovely horse.

ANDY: Do you like her?

FAYE: Would you like to be my escort?

ANDY: Now, get behind me.


TB drives off from the garage. Andy chases after him on his horse. In
Swordfish, Spike fires at Andy. Andy shoots a rocket at Swordfish.

SPIKE: You little...!

Spike returns fire. TB crashes into a pole. He spots Andy riding toward him
a trembles with fear. Andy completely ignore him and rides off after Spike.
Andy and Spike continue to return fire.

EYECATCH


Andy's floating home at a harbor on Mars. Faye sits in a gaudy cowboy-
themed room.

FAYE: In my life, I've never seen such a tasteless room.

Andy enters from the kitchen with two bowls of chunky soup.

ANDY: Now, I present you with my special "SON-OF-A-GUN STEW." I'm sure
you'll find it extremely delicious.

Faye forces laughter. She tries a spoonful of the soup and gags.

FAYE: Um... So why are you a bounty hunter? If you're so rich, uh, I mean
if you have so much comfort in your life...

ANDY: Why, Let's see... BECAUSE it suits me. That feeling a cowboy gets
when he corners a bull.

Andy laughs heartily. Faye forces laughter.

FAYE: Oh... but you don't have to go after such a dangerous bounty, do you?


Back on the Bebop.

JET: I know why nobody wants to go after Teddy Bomber. Nobody wants to get
a piece of the explosion!

SPIKE: You think we can worry about that?


Andy's abode.

ANDY: Yes! I don't worry about things like that! Once I set my mind on
something, I can see NOTHING else!

FAYE: I think I've seen this personality somewhere before...

Andy looks up.

FAYE: Oh, nothing...

ANDY: Now!

Andy raises a glass. Faye follows suit. Andy looks into Faye's eyes.

ANDY: Here's lookin' at my reflection, kid.

FAYE: Cheers...


The Bebop. Faye returns with a bag full of canned "SON-OF-A-GUN STEW."

FAYE: Hi, I got a souvenir.

ED: Yippie! A souvenir! A souvenir!

SPIKE: I ain't gonna eat THAT!

JET: Guess this is for dinner...

SPIKE: I will NOT eat that!

Ein barks.

SPIKE: Your stomach will suffer.

JET: But what about him makes you so hotheaded?

FAYE: They're too similar. You know how similar people hate each other.

SPIKE: What part of me is similar to that shit-headed idiot?!

JET: The part that makes you damn troublesome.

FAYE: Oh, Big Shot has already started.

Faye turns on the monitor.

PUNCH: Well, the last thing wehave to tell you is info about TB, Teddy
Bomber.

JUDY: Can you believe it? We got a message from him, just for this show!

Judy pulls out a long roll of paper.

PUNCH: What? Is that for real?

She reads the letter.

JUDY: Um, let's see... "Warning. This is for those who have made fun of me.
My next job is your last chance. This time, I'll blow YOU up as well,
like fireworks."

PUNCH: My, my, he doesn't sound calm.

JUDY: "That is, if you know where I will set up next. Heh, heh, heh. And
lastly, I will tell you my true intent - "

PUNCH: Whoops! Looks like time is up for us. That's all for today.

The closing credits roll.

JUDY: I'm sorry I couldn't read all of it, TB.

PUNCH: Well, until next time...

JUDY: Good luck!

ED: The next one's in City Hall...

JET: You figured it out already?

ED: TB is blowing up tall buildings starting with the tallest one...

FAYE: The reason was THAT simple?

JET: What are you gonna do? I'm getting outta this one!

FAYE: I'm gonna pass, too. Spike, what are you going to do?

SPIKE: Like you have to ask?


Outside City Hall.

TB: LATE! Dammit! If they think they can get away with this, they are
sorely mistaken -

Spike arrives.

SPIKE: You alone?

TB: How dare you take so much time to get here - !

Spike hears whistling. 

SPIKE: Wait!

Old Man Jobin walks by whistling.

SPIKE: Wrong guy...

TB: I have never intended humans as targets! But you guys are different!
Guys like you deserve -

He is interrupted by whistling.

SPIKE: He's here...

Andy rides toward them on his horse.

ANDY: YOU! It was you!

SPIKE: So you finally remember me. You always -

ANDY: You ALWAYS butt in and get in my way!

SPIKE: YOU'RE the one that's in the way!

TB: Now that I have both of you here, I will tell you. The reason why I
continue to blow buildings up. That is because -

Andy and Spike completely ignore TB.

ANDY: Today, we are going to settle the score once and for all.

SPIKE: WHAT?! That's MY line!

TB: Listen to what I have to say!

SPIKE & ANDY: Shut up!

ANDY: And you are? WHO ARE YOU?!

TB: C-Can't you guys put some effort into your work?!

TB detonates a bomb and runs.

SPIKE: We have to catch HIM first!

ANDY: Wait!

Spike and Andy chase after him leading them into an elevator. The doors
close. TB stands in another car.

TB: You guys take me too lightly. That elevator's doors will never open
again. And once it starts moving, that's the end. It will never stop.
At the top floor, my cute little bears will greet you. So, the moment
that the elevator reaches the top floor: BOOM! Well, live what little
you have of your life left without regret! Farewell, and good luck.

The elevator ascends.

ANDY: Rest assured. I understand... I KNOW how he does things.

SPIKE: Don't worry. I know how he does -

Spike opens up the control panel and pushes a few buttons. Nothing happens.

ANDY: This afternoon, I reverted the secret emergency code that had been
changed. YEAH!

SPIKE: I reverted it this afternoon! Change after change... means it's back
to where it started!

Andy fires a pistol. The bullet ricochets up and down the elevator.

SPIKE: Stop, you idiot!

ANDY: What do we do, what do we do?! OH, NO!

Spike opens the ceiling door. Andy goes up the door as well. The two are
stuck.

SPIKE: Wah, stop, shit, it's too tight! YOU are in the way!

ANDY: What?! Get outta the way, dammit!

The elevator reaches the top floor. The bears explode.


Outside the building.

TB: Farewell... Come to think of it, they were brave young men...

Faye taps TB on the shoulder.

FAYE: Hey!

TB turns around. Faye punches him out.


Spike and Andy miraculously survive. They begin to race to the remains of
the top floor.


From the ground, Jet and Faye watch Spike and Andy climb.

FAYE: They're climbing... those two monkeys...

JET: They like high places.

FAYE: So they ARE similar...

JET: Let's just go back...

FAYE: Then I'll go turn him in.

Faye kicks TB tied up on the ground.


At the remains of the top floor.

ANDY: YOU don't even deserve to be called a cowboy.

SPIKE: I will never for give you.

The exchange gunfire. They run out of bullets and begin to fight with their
fists. Spike fails to hit Andy. Enraged, he punches a crumbling wall. This
causes a chain reaction, causing the ground beneath Andy to up heave. Andy
hangs on to the edge. He climbs back up and.

ANDY: I lose...

Spike is baffled. Andy approaches Spike.

ANDY: That was some punch! You are a true cowboy. As of today, I will no
longer be a cowboy. This really is a hats-off!.

Andy puts his cowboy hat atop Spike's head. Andy's horse enters the floor
by way of another elevator.

SPIKE: So... what are ya gonna do now?

ANDY: I will no doubt find a new way of life... See you, space cowboy!

Andy rides his horse to the elevator. Spike stares at Andy, jaw agape.


The Bebop. Spike eats large spoonfuls of "SON-OF-A-GUN STEW."

SPIKE: Well, it was only a rich boy's hobby. His level, no, rank was really
no match for me. Hey, are ya listening?

JET: Yeah, yeah.

SPIKE: So, he just wasn't any enemy of mine. Of course, I never had him in
my line of sight. Hey, are ya listening?

JET: Yeah, yeah.


Somewhere on the road. A policeman converses with the arrested TB in a
police truck.

OFFICER: But anyway, why did you want to blow stuff up so much?

TB: I wanted to give a warning against all the unnecessary waste created by
capitalism lacking philosophy. Planets that needlessly get colonized.
Media that needlessly get circulated. And buildings that are needlessly
tall to symbolize all of this! And by destroying them, I wanted to
raise the question of how a true pioneer should be.

ANDY: Wait, wait, WAIT!

TB looks out the window. Andy, riding on his horse, is dressed in the guise
of a samurai complete with two katanas.

TB: Andy!

ANDY: Call me... MUSASHI! Go, JIROUMARU!

TB: But... It was all a waste, wasn't it...?

The policeman taps TB's shoulder.


SEE YOU SPACE SAMURAI...

ANDY: So, did you pay close attention to me and my wonderful role?

SPIKE: Hey, wait a minute...

ANDY: Now, the next episode, the next story -

Next Session
BRAIN SCRATCH

�ĝğďŕ�sil - September 21, 2005 03:20 AM (GMT)
Brain Scratch

OPENING CREDITS


The television. Doctor Londes, a man who has been appearing frequently on
the television recently promoting a religious movement called SCRATCH.

LONDES: What is a physical body? The body is merely an object. It is an
existence all too impure to store the gods within us called souls.
Now you will remember. The blood stained history! Material desire.
Hunger. Sexual drive. Desire to dominate. Desire for fame. As long
as there is a body, desires will be born. As long as there is
desire, human ego will not disappear. Humans will continue to
fight to fulfill their bodies' desires, and it will never end. At
this rate, there is no future! Now awaken your soul! Now be rid of
that filthy body!

SCRATCH MEMBERS: We are SCRATCH, an electronic transcendence group. We are
disciples of God, sent here to free your soul from your
body and lead you to the infinite sea of electrons.


Session #23
BRAIN SCRATCH


CBC News. Anchorman Mark Rather.

RATHER: Good evening. This is CBC News. First, we have news about the
electronic transcendence group SCRATCH. Last week, the ISSP and all
Sol Solar system police departments received the subpoena for the
leader, Londes and began searching the homes of high-ranking
members...


The channel is changed. Another news program on SCRATCH. graphic shots of
dead SCRATCH members are shown. The headline: "Insane Order! SCRATCH."
Reporter Samantha Copeland stands before a large crowd.

COPELAND: Here at the scene, enticing people with "easy entry" and
"salvation of the soul," SCRATCH has been able to constantly
grow in numbers. However, another suicide -


The channel is changed. Another news program on SCRATCH.

ANCHOR: The members of SCRATCH use the brain wave control device on this
new game console to scan their own brain waves and use a program
created by their leader, Londes which is said to copy the spirit
from brain waves as digital data and upload that spirit data into
the universal network. They believe that doing this will make them
exist as a soul without a body. Now Professor they say that Londes,
the leader, was once a doctor. Is such a thing possible?

PROFESSOR: This is ridiculous. Completely in the realm of science fiction.
It may be theoretically possible to do so but a theory is only a
theory, in the end.


The channel is changed. A talk show. A sobbing woman talks to the host. Her
face and voice are censored.

WOMAN: Yes, and he hasn't returned for two weeks.

HOST: Lady, you have to talk it out with your husband. It's about your
son -

WOMAN: But... he isn't the type that would just run away from home...
Could he have been kidnapped?!

HOST: Lady, are you listening to what I'm saying?

WOMAN: That's got to be it! That religion that's been popular lately...
That whatchamacallit -

HOST: All right, we're gonna take a break.


An commercial featuring an exercise machine presented by celebrity David
Blakely.

BLAKELY: Hi! Today, I'm introducing Power CDJ, an item for DJ's who don't
exercise much! You adjust the BPM using this lever and it allows
you to be a DJ while you exercise!


The channel is changed. Another news program. The reporter is live at a
chapter of SCRATCH. She interviews Faye.

REPORTER: Then, the reason you decided to join is...?

FAYE: Yes, ur, I... I got tired of a debt-filled life and that was when I
found this... Yes... If I rid myself of a body, I'll no longer need
money!


The Bebop. Spike is disgusted.

SPIKE: Hey, Jet!

Jet is cooking.

JET: Hold on, it's almost done.

SPIKE: I don't care! Just get over here!

Jet watches the monitor.

FAYE: By releasing the spirit from the body, we are able to discard all
desire.

REPORTER: So you're not going to pay your debt?

JET: I thought we hadn't seen her in a while. What kind of joke is this?


The channel is changed. A commercial.

ANNOUNCER: Brain Dream! The new game console, Brain Dream, can read your
mind! Control YOUR games the way that YOU want to! Are you
always fighting with your controls? Do the cords get tangled? If
that's the case, then LET'S DREAM together!


The channel is changed. A girl among a mountain of stuffed toys.

GIRL: And so, at our station, we have the strictest policies in the world,
and against programs such as this...


Jet flips through files on the computer to find one on Londes. The rest
eat.

JET: Oh, there it is.

ED: I'm gonna eat now!

JET: Doctor Londes. Wanted for murder. The bounty is an amazing 38 million.

SPIKE: I see. That's enough for her to go freelance on us.

JET: This guy was apparently a neurobiology researcher fifty years ago.
However, one day he suddenly had a vision from God and immersed
himself in research to store the human spirit, the functions of the
brain itself, as digital data. Since then, he's been missing... Then,
two years ago, he suddenly reappeared to form the electronic
transcendence group SCRATCH.

SPIKE: What the hell is that?

JET: In other words, a new religious cult. Anyway, according to him, the
human brain function itself is a weak stream of electronic pulses so
if you are able to copy that as data, and replay it over the universal
network as a program, you can exist only as a soul... Are you
listening to me?

SPIKE: Well, it's up to you to believe it or not.

JET: There are already 20,000 believers. Of which approximately 100 have
committed suicide or ended up missing. And so the cops have started
moving their lazy asses.

Spike looks at the file photograph.

SPIKE: His face ain't appetizing.

Ed finishes her food.

ED: Seconds!

JET: That's all.

Ed falls back.

JET: We're gonna go after him, too.


The SCRATCH commercial plays again.

SCRATCH MEMBERS: We are SCRATCH, an electronic transcendence group. We are
disciples of God, sent here to free your soul from your
body and lead you to the infinite sea of electrons.


At a rundown building, Faye looks for Londes. She finds dead bodies near a
tower of monitors. She draws her gun. Suddenly the monitors turn on. Her
vision blurs.


Jet is on the streets.


On the Bebop. Ed looks for Londes on the internet.

ED: Searching, searching, where are you?


On the street, Spike talks to a member of SCRATCH.

SCRATCH MEMBER A: Oh, so you want to be a member as well?

SPIKE: Y-Yeah, I guess...

SCRATCH MEMBER A: For that, we need to cleanse your soul first. As the
first step.

SPIKE: Uh... before that, I want to meet this Mr. Londes... Do you know
where he is?

SCRATCH MEMBER A: Oh, of course.

SPIKE: Really?

SCRATCH MEMBER A: He's in heaven.


The Bebop. Ed's search continues.


Jet talks to an old man, presumably a colleague of Londes.'

OLD MAN: Londes...? Hum, did such a guy exist?

JET: Ya gotta help me, old man. You're the only colleague of his that is
still alive. Can't you remember something? Anything?

OLD MAN: Maybe he existed... Maybe he didn't...

JET: Which is it?

The old man falls asleep.


On the street, Spike talks to another member of SCRATCH.

SCRATCH MEMBER B: Oh, then you want to be a member as well?

SPIKE: Yeah, I guess...

SCRATCH MEMBER B: For that, we need to cleanse your soul first. As the
first step.

SPIKE: Oh, can I ask something before that? I want to see Mr. Londes...
Well, anything, his soul or whatever, will do, but how can I meet
him?

The SCRATCH member is annoyed.

SCRATCH MEMBER B: Do you really want to become a member?


The Bebop. Ed is unable to find on Londes.


Big Shot.

PUNCH: And so Dr. Londes is the center of everyone's attention...

JUDY: The first big-name guy in a while!

PUNCH: Unfortunately, we have absolutely no new information!

JUDY: Oh, my...

PUNCH: Everyone is doing their best to find him, but there just isn't any
information. We're seeing his face virtually every day from
SCRATCH's TV programs, but we know nothing important about him.

JUDY: Is he really a soul without a body?

PUNCH: Now, I have one other bit of important news for you.

JUDY: Oh? What is it?

PUNCH: Actually...

JUDY: Hurry up and tell me!

PUNCH: We've been on the air for a long time now and I know it's sudden,
but this is our final episode!

Judy in enraged.

JUDY: You're kidding!

PUNCH: They're canning us because of low ratings, unfortunately...

Judy punches out Punch.

JUDY: Unfortunately?! How come I didn't hear about this?!


Back on the Bebop.

JET: No good?

SPIKE: No good.

JET: I got nothing, either.

ED: Nope, nope...

Ed whines.

JET: I went after his colleagues from his research days but it was all for
nothing.

SPIKE: And I got nothing out of the members.

The computer receives a call from a dazed Faye.

ED: Oh, it's Faye-Faye.

FAYE: I'm in... a little... trouble. Are you listening...? I think I really
can... get rid of my debt...

Faye passes out and the connection is lost.


EYECATCH


A toy store. Jet is in line for the videogame system. He talks to Spike
through his communicator.

JET: Anyway, I'm trusting you with Faye.

SPIKE: And I'm gonna be having a hard time if you're gonna be baby-sitting
forever...

JET: As I said - !

Jet lowers his voice.

JET: Brain Dream is pretty rare! I have to line up here if I want one!

SPIKE: Are you really going to hack into his website?

JET: That's the only lead we got left. Beyond that... Faye seems to have
dug something up, so we can use that...

SPIKE: Oof, it's about that time.

Spike flies to a crater on Mars.


The Bebop. Jet puts on Brain Dream.

JET: All right, go for it.

Ed sits by the computer.

ED: Okay...

The SCRATCH program boots up.

PROGRAM: Welcome to SCRATCH, an electronic transcendence group. Head
straight if you wish to join us. Head over that way to request
more detailed information about SCRATCH.

JET: So I guess I can't copy my spirit immediately... Guess I have no
choice...

PROGRAM: Joining us? Please input your personal data.

Jet points to Ed.

ED: Data, data. Fake data!

Ed inputs phony information. The program starts.

LONDES: Blood, muscle, and bone... When those are lost, humans face
death...

Ein growls.

LONDES: What lies beyond that? Heaven? Hell? Reincarnation? Such things
cannot possibly exist. Those are mere excuses...

Ein barks.

ED: What's wrong?

JET: What is this?

LONDES: None of the previous paths to salvation had such a clear vision as
this...

Jet is paralyzed.

LONDES: Awaken your spirit! Now be rid of that filthy body!

Ein bites Jet in the thigh. Jet screams and regains consciousness.


Parked outside of the rundown building, Spike speaks to Jet through his
communicator.

SPIKE: High frequency?

JET: Yeah. I'm not exactly sure but it has some contraption that paralyzes
the sympathetic nerves. In just seconds, everything before my eyes
went blank and I passed out. If Ein didn't realize it and bite me, I
would have been -

SPIKE: - a member of SCRATCH.

JET: Anyway, we need to devise a counter measure to -

SPIKE: Well, I'll try becoming a member now.

JET: Hey, Spike! Hey!

Spike hangs up.


The Bebop. Ein wears Brain Dream.

JET: I'm sure dogs have brain waves, too...

ED: Ed wanna wear it too!

JET: If you become a member, who is going to look Londes up? Do it.

PROGRAM: Welcome to SCRATCH, an electronic transcendence gr-

The program is hacked quickly.

JET: Oh! Good going, Ed!

Ed is confused. She isn't doing a thing. Ein bobs his head left, right,
front and back. The hacking reveals Londes' location.

JET: This is... Can this really be...?


Spike walks through the halls of the rundown building.


The Bebop. Jet examines the info.

JET: A guy named Londes never existed. His past, all the records they were
all counterfeit. And all the controls lead back to here... Alles
Valley Hospice. Ed, help me.


Spike continues to walk through the building.



Alles Valley Hospice. Jet is dressed in a suit. Ed is dressed in a pink
dress holding a bouquet of flowers. Ed tugs at Jet's sleeve.

ED: Papa!

JET: Not yet!

ED: Papa!

They walk in.


The rundown building. Spike finds Faye and the monitor tower.


The hospice.

GUARD: Nobody here would want visitors. And you need an appointment to see
someone. Or did you come here for inheritance?

JET: Nothing of the sort! Actually, this girl's twin brother is here.

ED: Papa!

GAURD: Girl...? Is she really a girl?

ED: Papa!

Jet feigns sadness.

JET: A-Actually... it's a long story...


The rundown building. Londes appears on the monitors.

LONDES: I'm just having her sleep. Of course, the other bounty hunters all
slept to death.


The hospice.

JET: We finally tracked the long-lost brother to be here.

ED: Papa!

JET: It was a shock to my daughter... She has been insane ever since... and
I thought about having her meet her brother just once.

The guard dries tears from his eyes.

GAURD: You can go.

JET: I can't thank you enough.


The rundown building.

SPIKE: Why do you kill off your members? What's your purpose?

LONDES: I am not forcing anything. They are merely practicing a faith that
they decided to believe. Why do you think people believe in God?
It's because they want to. It's not easy living in this rotten
world. There is nothing certain while living on in this world. Do
you get it? God didn't create humans. Humans created God.


The hospice. Jet and Ed are lead by the information to the bed of an
unconscious young boy.

JET: He's it...?


The rundown building.

SPIKE: I'm sick of this little act. What's wrong? Come on out. An illusion
isn't enough for me.

LONDES: That is correct... A man named Londes does not exist in this world.
He is merely an imaginary character I created a mere illusion
created by scanning lines.


The hospice. Jet examines the machinery.

JET: Is this a brain wave controller like Brain Dream? Hey, Ed. Can you cut
off the connection between the brain wave controller and the network?

ED: Yeah.

JET: All right. But don't turn off the life support system.


The rundown building.

LONDES: Do you know what the greatest and worst invention that humans ever
made was? Television. Television controls people using information
and steals their sense of reality. Yes. Now television itself is a
religion.

Spike's vision begins to blur

LONDES: TV has created people that are easily fooled by such an idiotic
fantasy.

Spike shoots out several monitors. He grows weak. Suddenly Spike smiles.

SPIKE: Just like a little kid.

LONDES: What...?

SPIKE: YOU are the one who can't tell... fantasy from reality, Londes. If
you want to dream, dream alone.

Londes is angered.

LONDES: W-What do you know?! What do you think you know about me?

Londes' connection begins to fade.

LONDES: What- What are you doing?! Stop! Help! You can't do that! Stop!
Shit! Stop it! Stop it! Don't turn it off!. What... What did I do?!
N-No... This is unfair... Why... am I the only one...? Shit...
Everyone should have had the same body as me... No... I... I don't
want to disappear! I don't want to disappear...

The image goes blank.


The hospice. Jet handcuffs Spangen.

JET: Ronny Spangen. Previously a hacker. A boy who became a vegetable two
years ago... when he was 13, from a medical accident. No... you are no
longer a boy. You're a damn good con artist.


The rundown building. Faye wakes up. Spike smiles at her.

FAYE: Oh, long time no see. Where am I?


Jet and Ed walk out of the hospice.

JET: It was all a kid's dream. Yeah, all he could do was dream...

ED: This time, have sweet dreams.


Spangen continues to dream.

LONDES: Our souls that God has given us... our spirit. Is not our body an
existence all too small and weak for our spirits which found a way
to swim through the vast network and live in the infinity of space?

Hard Luck Woman

Faye watches the beta tape in the darkness of her room. She pauses it at a 
shot of a stone lion head fountain. She closely examines it. Suddenly she
is startled by the presence of a dreary Ed.

FAYE: S-Since when were you...

ED: Water sploosh...

FAYE: You know this?

ED: I think I know, I don't think I know. I don't think I know that I know.
I think I know even though I don't think I know...

FAYE: Which is it?!

Ed falls asleep.

FAYE: Hey!

Faye grabs Ed and blows air into her mouth.


Session #24
HARD LUCK WOMAN


Earth. Spike brushes his teeth on the deck of the Bebop. Jet rushes out.

JET: Hey, Spike, where the hell are we?!

SPIKE: Isn't it Earth?

JET: Earth?! Hey, this ship was headed for Mars! Why the hell are we on
Earth all of a sudden?!

SPIKE: Dunno.

JET: Shit, this isn't funny. While we're wasting time, our fugitive - It
was the first big one in a while... In any case, why the hell are we
on - ?

SPIKE: Jet. The women are gone.


Faye flies in Red Tail. Ed is strapped to the top.

FAYE: Listen, if you lead me to that "water sploosh" place I'll give you
something good.

ED: Good thing? What?

FAYE: Something very, tremendously, wonderfully good.

ED: Something very, tremendously, wonderfully good!


A meteor crashes on a patch of land. A truck approaches it. Two mapmakers,
Appledelhi and Macintire rush down into the crater to measure it. Their
feet are burned.

APPLEDELHI: HOT! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!


In a pile of rubble. Ed digs up a watering can. 

ED: This! Water sploosh!

FAYE: I knew I shouldn't have trusted you...

A group of orphans emerge from the rubble and approach them.

CHILD: Hey, I found Ed!

ED: Ed has been found?

FAYE: What, you know them?

The children circle Faye. A boy named Sean randomly counts.

SEAN: 35 point 38 point 0, 35 point 48 point 1 , 35 point 48 point 2 -

A boy named Cain shoves a strange mechanical object in Faye's face.

CAIN: This! This, this, this!

A girl named Zuzu with a jar of yellow nails approaches Faye.

ZUZU: Hey, can I have your nails?

FAYE: Nails?

ZUZU: I'm collecting them!

She pulls out a clipper.

ZUZU: Can I, please? Just the pinky one will do!

SEAN: 35 point 52 point 3, 35 point...

CAIN: This, this!

ZUZU: Come on... can I have it? Please?

The nun caring for these children, Sister Clara, turns on a hose.

CLARA: What are you guys?!

She sprays Faye. A children hide behind a small pile of junk. Suddenly
Clara notices Ed.

FAYE: HEY!

Clara notices Ed.

CLARA: ED?! Is that really you... Ed?


An orphanage. The roof is decorated with pinwheels.

CLARA: I'm sorry about that. That's the best way to make the kids listen.

Faye dries her hair with a towel.

FAYE: It's all right. Is Ed from this place?

CLARA: She wandered in about five years ago. Before I knew it, she was
eating with us as if it had always been that way. And about three
years ago, she wandered away. As if she was a cat or something. I
was wondering how she was doing nowadays but I didn't think she
would suddenly appear.

Clara raises her voice.

CLARA: All right, it's time to eat!

The children gather around the table.

CLARA: Our Father who art in heaven... Never mind the rest. Let's eat!

CHILDREN: Let's eat!

The children eat heartily. Faye stares at the fish head in her bowl.

FAYE: I have to get going now...

CLARA: What, you can stay longer, right?

FAYE: I'm actually looking for something...

ED: Ed knows where it is. We just came here for food.

FAYE: You...

ED: You have to gimme something good!

CLARA: Oh yeah, Ed. There's something good in the desk drawer over there.

ED: Something good?

CLARA: Go get it.

ED: Something good!

Ed runs to the drawer.

CLARA: Inside that drawer.

Ed picks up Cain's object.

CLARA: Not that.

Ed picks up a compact hologram projector.

CLARA: Yeah, that. Open it!

Ed opens it. It projects an image of Appledelhi.

CLARA: Her father.

FAYE: WHOSE?

CLARA: He came looking for Ed about 2 months ago. He said he forgot that he
had put her in a day care center and that he had been looking for
seven years, hopping around the world. I hope she will be able to
meet him... People have to cherish what ties they have...


A crater. Appledelhi and Macintire chart the new formation. The map is
updated.

APPLEDELHI: Yeah!


The Lion Head Fountain. Stay stand by it. The place is now in ruins. An
elderly woman in a wheelchair approaches Faye. She is Sally Yung, a former
classmate.

SALLY: Are you... Faye?

Faye turns around.

SALLY: Impossible... Really? It's me, Sally Yung! I was in your high school
graduating class!

Sally coughs.

FAYE: Are you all right?

SALLY: I was really surprised. I thought you were a ghost. You look just
like back then... You know, they say ghosts appear in places where
they have regrets... Oh, yeah, I remember now. You were put in cold
sleep after that accident. And that's why you look like back then...

FAYE: Accident?

SALLY: You don't remember, Faye?

FAYE: I-I...

A little girls runs toward Sally.

GIRL: Grandma! Grandma, we gotta go back now.

SALLY: Is it that time already? Do you know who this is? I bet you don't
know.

The girl looks at Faye.

SALLY: Actually, she's -

Faye smiles.

FAYE: - a ghost. Good-bye. Take care.

Faye runs off, grabs Ed and takes off.


EYECATCH


The Bebop. Faye and Ed return.

JET: Hey, you guys! What's with this course change without asking?! Our
plans have all been screwed because of it! I don't appreciate you
doing things on your own!

Faye stares at Jet. Jet is silent. Faye goes into her room.


Ed's room. Ein walks in.

ED: You want to smell something really good?

Ed lets Ein smell the hologram projector.


The living room.

JET: What's with them? What are they being so secretive about?

SPIKE: Leave them alone.

JET: Maybe they're too hungry for their own good. Humans go insane if they
don't eat food.

Spike sees new bounty data on the monitor. It is Appledelhi.

SPIKE: 50 million...?

JET: I see... pretty big. Appledelhi Siniz Hesap Lutfen.


Parked near the water, Appledelhi eats raw eggs.

APPLEDELHI: Would you like one, Mackenroe?

MACINTIRE: That's Macintire. No thank you, Mr. Appledelhi.

APPLEDELHI: You sure? Eggs are good. As they say, power and charge. That's
what's important, Macintosh.

MACINTIRE: That's Macintire. Why is it that you can't ever remember your
assistant's name?

APPLEDELHI: Hm, don't worry about the small things in life.

A meteor crashes. Appledelhi climbs back into the ship.

APPLEDELHI: Hurry, Macky-Mike!

MACINTIRE: That's Macintire!

They speed off.


The Bebop. Faye suddenly regains a memory. She remembers the shuttle
accident.

Faye bumps into Spike in the hallway.

SPIKE: Watch where you're going! Hey...?

Faye stares blankly. She looks at Spike.

FAYE: Sorry...

Spike looks at Faye confused.

SPIKE: Sorry?

FAYE: I-I... I have to go...


The deck. Faye prepares to leave in Red Tail. Ed pops up.

ED: Going out? Where are you going?

FAYE: I finally remembered where I belong.

ED: Where you belong?

FAYE: You have someone waiting for you too... You have somewhere you
belong. You should go look for it, too. That's the best thing, you
know...

Faye takes off.


The Bebop.

JET: This one is a piece of cake. 50 million is right there! If they can
eat sukiyaki with meat, then they -

SPIKE: Faye went out.

JET: Again? Where the hell did she go this time? A woman's heart and the
skies of Ganymede, was it...?



A crater. Jet points a gun at Appledelhi.

SPIKE: You're Appledelhi? Can you come along with us?

JET: Cooperate with us if you don't wanna get hurt.

MACINTIRE: Who are you guys? Don't interrupt our work!

JET: Work?

APPLEDELHI: This Earth of wild chaos! What do we need to do to regain a
peaceful peace and end the chaos here? That is a map! A map!
Yes, happiness comes in the form of a map!

MACINTIRE: We are creating maps to save the Earth!

JET: A map...? But meteors fall often and change the landscape.

MACINTIRE: That's why we're globe trotting. We're chasing after every
meteor! Until every single meteor falls onto Earth!

Jet looks at Spike with skepticism. Spike draws his gun.

SPIKE: Enough with the excuses!

Appledelhi throws two eggs, hitting Jet in the head and Spike's guns.

SPIKE: You!

Spike rushes forward, throwing punches at Appledelhi. He dodges and head
butts Spike.

SPIKE: I wasn't expecting someone this adept.

Spike rushes forward again and Appledelhi defeats him. Again, and Spike
loses again. Suddenly the Bebop lands in front of them advancing pass the
shoreline and crashing into the land.

JET: Is that you, Ed?!

SPIKE: That's enough! Stop!

It stops in front of Appledelhi. Ed looks down from the deck. Appledelhi
looks up. He smiles and opens his arm.

APPLEDELHI: Francoise!

Ed dives down and Appledelhi catches her by her ankles. He swings her round
and round and catches her.

APPLEDELHI: How's that? And that, and that?

Ed walks forward and introduces Appledelhi to Spike and Jet.

ED: This is father-person.

SPIKE: Father...?

JET: Your father?

SPIKE: She had such a thing?

Ed introduces Spike and Jet to Appledelhi.

ED: This is Spike-person and Jet-person.

APPLEDELHI: I see.

He walks forward and head butts Spike to the ground.

ED: No, father. Good people.

APPLEDELHI: Oh? I see. Thank you for taking care of my son. Or was it
daughter? Oh, well, it's all right either way. That's a token
of my appreciation.

He putts a basket of eggs on Spike.

JET: Then, Ed, were you the one who put the bounty on...

Jet rereads the bounty data and notices a decimal point in the number
instead of a comma.

JET: Fifty point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero? Only 50 Woolongs...?

APPLEDELHI: So, you wanna come with me?

Another meteor crashes in the horizon.

APPLEDELHI: Hurry, Michael-duck!

MACINTIRE: That's Macintire!

They speed off.

ED: Hey, wait! Father! He's gone.


Elsewhere. Faye returns to her former home and finds that it is no more.
All that is left is a fountain with a broken lion head and an empty lot.


The Bebop. Ed gives Spike a pinwheel and leaves. Jet cooks the eggs in the
kitchen. Ein senses something, looks up at Jet and heads for the door. He
gives Jet one more look and then leaves. Outside, Ein gives the Bebop
another look, begins to head back, then turns around and head for Ed.

Jet looks into the living room.

JET: Hey, it's dinner time...

The living room is empty.


Jet finds Spike in the control room looking out on the deck.

JET: Spike, dinner.

On the deck, Ed has written "Bye Bye" with a large smiley face.


The empty lot. Faye draws a rectangle on the ground where her bed would
have been, then lies down and watches the sunset.


The Bebop. Jet and Spike eat their share of the eggs alone.


Earth. Ein finds Ed.

ED: You can't come with me, Ein. Ed is going someplace far, far away. I
might not be coming back. So, Ein, you should go back home.

Ein whines.

ED: Do you want to come with Ed?


The Bebop. Spike and Jet begin to eat the rest of the eggs.


Earth.

ED: Let's go, Ein!

Ein barks.

The two run into the sunset.


SEE YOU COWGIRL,
SOMEDAY, SOMEWHERE!

JET: Everything has a beginning... and an end. Life is just a cycle of

OPENING CREDITS


Mars. Julia walks into an apartment. A recorded messege from her informant,
Shin plays.

SHIN: The elders are going to be on the move. It is dangerous over there as
well. Please hurry.


Session #25
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (PART I)


Red Dragon Headquarters. Vicious and a group of thugs enter the dark main
chamber. The thugs fire machine guns. Suddenly the lights turn on.


WANG LONG: What a foolish act you have done. The fortune-teller told us
thus. "The night of the red moon, the snake will slither
horribly quickly to make use of its venomous fangs."

PING LONG: You look so pitiful, Vicious.

SOU LONG: We have informed you of our decision that you cannot be our
successor.

VICIOUS: The syndicate does not need corpses who cannot even fight.

WANG LONG: That arrogance of yours will ruin everything in the end. Take
him to the punishment chamber.

VICIOUS: Kill me. Right now.

WANG LONG: You cannot choose how you will die. After we let you have a good
taste of humiliation we will send you into the underworld.

Vicious is taken away.

VICIOUS: Don't forget a snake's venom poisons slowly after the bite.


Loser Bar, somewhere on Mars. Jet and Spike sit at the counter, depressed.

JET: Sheesh, that was the first time we screwed up so badly. We never had
anything like that before when we were all alone. All told, they
screwed up our plans right to the end. They really were like
troublesome babies. I completely understand why you hate women and
kids now.

Jet and Spike sense danger from outside. They duck and gunfire enters from
outside, killing the unsuspecting bartender. Spike grabs his drink from the
bartender and takes a sip.

SPIKE: Too much vermouth.

Spike fires back and guns down a thug.

JET: Who are they?

Jet is shot in the thigh. Shin enters.

SPIKE: Lin?!

SHIN: I'm Shin, his younger brother.

SPIKE: Shin... That's right, you two were -

Shin shoots a thug.

SPIKE: If you change sides, you won't be able to return to the syndicate.
What happened?

SHIN: Vicious is to be executed. He failed to pull off the coup, and has
been put under restraints by the elders. You are in danger as well.
And Miss Julia...

SPIKE: Julia is?

SHIN: They're in the city of Tharsis. I'll hold them off here. Please go!

SPIKE: I'll owe you one, Shin!

Spike and Jet escape.


At the doctor's office. The doctor fixes up Jet's wound. Spike is in deep
thought.

JET: I don't know what happened to Red Dragon but it's not really your
problem now, right? Vicious, Julia... To me, both those names sound
nothing but ominous. Just like a magic spell that opens a door that
shouldn't be opened. You're -

The doctor takes the bullet out of Jet's thigh. Jet writhes in pain.

DOCTOR: Hold still.

JET: You are no longer a member of the syndicate...

SPIKE: I know.

Jet looks at the doctor.

JET: You too... Forget everything, including the fact that we came here.

DOCTOR: What are you talking about? I'm just treating stray cats that
wandered into the office. Stray cats that I can't ever get rid
of...


Spike recalls a moment in Julia's apartment three years ago.

SPIKE: When this is over, I'm leaving the syndicate.

JULIA: You'll be killed.

SPIKE: I'll let them say I'm dead. I'll be waiting at the graveyard. Of
course, I will be alive.

JULIA: I... can't come with you.

SPIKE: Come with me. We'll leave here... We'll escape from this world.

JULIA: And then what are we going to do?

SPIKE: We'll just live a life of freedom somewhere. Just like watching a
dream...


On the road in a red convertible, Julia recalls another moment.

VICIOUS: Are you going to betray me? Are you going to leave this world...?

JULIA: Vicious.

VICIOUS: Even if it's a dream, that's an impossibility.

JULIA: Are you going to kill him?

VICIOUS: Yeah... with your hands. You stay alive... or you both die. You
can choose.


The chamber. Vicious is chained to the wall.


At a spaceport on Mars. Faye overhears an old woman talking to herself.

WOMAN: So there is no place for me after all. I won't go no matter who
comes to pick me up. Never. I don't want to live a life where I'm
always in someone's way.

A familiar-looking man runs to the woman.

MAN: Mom! I've been looking for you!

WOMAN: A-Alfred...

MAN: I told you to wait in front of the curry restaurant!

WOMAN: Sorry.

MAN: It's all right. I'm glad you came.

WOMAN: It sounds too good to be true that you can take care of me now.

MAN: Mom, I want to live with you.

WOMAN: You found a job?

MAN: Don't worry about that.

WOMAN: What about your female co-host?

MAN: I heard she's getting married.

The two walk away.

FAYE: Something about this...


The garage at the spaceport. Faye walks to Red Tail and recieves a call.

SPIKE: Where are you now?

FAYE: What is it?

SPIKE: I'm heading out to the city of Tharsis. You should head that way,
too.

FAYE: Why?

SPIKE: It's hard for Jet to get around on his own. Especially after getting
shot in the leg. I'm telling ya to stop wandering around so much,
and just come back.

FAYE: Don't just assume that I'm coming back! You've got to be kidding! I
have a place to go back to!

Faye hangs up.

FAYE: What's with that attitude? Like he's all high-and-mighty. What does
he mean, Jet's by himself? HE's there... Ed and Ein too...

Suddenly, Julia's convertible speeds down the street. A syndicate car
Chases her, firing. Faye shoots one of the cars' tires flat. Julia gives
her a lift. Another car continues chasing the convertible. Faye shoots the
hubcap off the car. The car spins out of control and flips over.


EYECATCH


Julia and Faye take a break on the side of the road.

JULIA: You saved me.

FAYE: Same here.

JULIA: You're a good shot.

FAYE: I was getting bounties with it.

Julia looks at Faye.

JULIA: A bounty hunter...?

FAYE: Although now I'm kind off on a break 'cause there's something going
on. You look like you have something going on, too. It might be good
to pair up with another woman. How about it? Wanna be my partner?

JULIA: I have... something to do.

FAYE: Oh. Too bad.

JULIA: Do you know any bounty hunter hangouts?

FAYE: I can help if you want to put a bounty on someone.

JULIA: I'm looking for a bounty hunter. I'll drive you back.


On the road.

JULIA: What's your name?

FAYE: Faye...

Julia looks up.

JULIA: Faye...?!

FAYE: Faye Valentine. A common name. What's yours?

JULIA: Julia.

Faye looks up.

FAYE: Julia...?!

JULIA: It's a common name.

Julia stops at the spaceport garage.

JULIA: I'm glad I met you.

FAYE: Me too. Um, have I seen you somewhere...?

JULIA: If... you see Spike again... Tell him that I will be waiting there.
He'll know what I mean. Tell him that I'll keep waiting...

FAYE: Why...?

JULIA: Good-bye, Faye Valentine.

Julia drives off.

FAYE: Why? Why do you know?!


The Bebop. Jet wakes up in an empty living room. Walking on a crutch, he
finds Spike in the control room.

SPIKE: Does it still hurt?

JET: Do you know a story that goes like this? A man injured his leg during
a hunt. In the middle of the savanna with no means to treat the wound,
the leg rots, and death approaches. The man got onto the airplane that
finally arrived and there he sees a land of pure white below him. The
place glistening in the light was the summit of a snow-covered
mountain. The name of the mountain was Kilimanjaro. The man thinks
"That was where he was headed..."

SPIKE: And?

JET: I hate this story. Men only think about the past right before their
death, as if they were searching frantically for proof that they were
alive. Turn back. You told me when we first met that you were a man
who had already died once. Just forget the past, okay?

They look down at the surface of Mars.

SPIKE: There was a woman. For the first time in my life I saw a woman that
was truly alive. That's what I believed. She was a piece of me I had
lost. She is my other half that I had longed for.

Jet stares at Spike.

SPIKE: She's back.

JET: Hm? Who...?


Oh, man...

We're not a repair shop. Don't come back just when you broke something -

FAYE: Where is he?

JET: He?

FAYE: The one with the fluffy hair.

JET: What, can't you just say you're looking for Spike?

FAYE: Where is he?

JET: He's in the workshop. What are you trying to hide? You came back here
just to see Spike?

FAYE: I was asked to relay a message from Julia.

JET: Hey, wait!!

Jet receives a call.

BOB: Jet, it's me.

JET: What, I don't have any information now. We're not really able to -

BOB: I'm glad you're all right. I was worried. It's getting to be pretty
bad, you know...

JET: About Red Dragon?

BOB: Yeah... There was apparently a coup two days ago concerning who was
going to be the syndicate's successor. In the end the elders won, and
they're now out to annihilate anyone who was involved in the coup.
Your partner will also -

JET: Been there. But why are they trying to get rid of those that already
left the syndicate?

BOB: Anything against them will be annihilated, down to the very last seed.
That's how they do it.

JET: That's the worst logic I've ever heard.

BOB: Just run. The police can't handle all of it. Leave Mars.

JET: Too late for that.


The workshop. Faye stands at the doorway. She tries to speak to Spike but
no words would come out. Spike notices her.

SPIKE: You have something? You look like you have some information.

FAYE: How much will you pay for it?

SPIKE: I don't have any money.

Syndicate ships from outside shoot at the Bebop. The entire ship shakes.

SPIKE: You sure came back at the worst time...

FAYE: Weren't you the one who called me here?

SPIKE: Or... maybe they followed you here? Oh, well. It was gonna happen
sooner or later.

FAYE: Wait!

Faye chases Spike into the hanger. Spike hops onboard Swordfish.

FAYE: Wait a minute!

SPIKE: I don't have any money.

FAYE: She said she'll be waiting there. She said you'd understand.

SPIKE: I don't get it.

FAYE: It was from a woman named Julia. Someone was after her... They were
chasing her...

SPIKE: Jet, I can go at any time.

Spike takes off.


The Chamber. The elders and a firing squad stand before Vicious.

WANG LONG: You who caused a disturbance in our clan's affairs. By the will
of the clan, you shall be executed.


Spike struggles to defend the Bebop from the syndicate ships.

FAYE: Let me out too!

JET: Wait! Your right thruster isn't working yet!

FAYE: The end is the same if we go down ship and all!

SOU LONG: Will you leave words?

PING LONG: Or leave something material?

VICIOUS: Nothing.

The firing squad members raise their guns.


The Bebop. Spike continues defending the ship. Red Tail takes off.


The Chamber. Vicious bird enters emerges from the darkness and explodes,
launching smoke bombs. Vicious is freed.


The Bebop. Spike and Faye continue defending the Bebop.


The Chamber. Sou Long and Ping Long are killed by gunfire. Vicious receives
his sword, approaches Wang Long and puts his blade to Wang Long's eyes. The
thugs pause.

VICIOUS: You shall shed red tears.

Vicious stashes.


The Bebop. Spike destroys the last of the syndicate fighters.

JET: Spike, can you still fly? Don't worry about us. Just go! Go grasp that
thing you had lost. GO!


Spike flies away.


The Chamber.

VICIOUS: As of now, the leadership has changed hands. From now on, I will
dictate all authority and symbolism of this syndicate.


A graveyard. Spike finds Julia waiting for him. She points a gun at him.

JET: It sure was long...

FAYE: The past is the past...

SPIKE: No use doing this...

FAYE: ...and the future is the future.

SPIKE: So how was it, Jet?

FAYE: A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.

JET: Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.

FAYE: I am who I am, and you are who you are.

JET: Dogs are really cute after all...

FAYE: Like it really matters any...

The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)

The cemetery. Julia is pointing her gun at Spike.

JULIA: It was raining that day as well...

SPIKE: You didn't come because of the rain?

JULIA: I was supposed to kill you. That day if I had killed you I would
have been free.

SPIKE: So why didn't you? Why did you choose to be pursued?

JULIA: Why did you love me?

Julia puts down the gun and embraces Spike.

JULIA: Let's just run away somewhere. Truly escape from this world and go
where no one else is... Just the two of us...


Session #26
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (PART II)


The chamber. Lin enters to see the remains of the carnage. Vicious
approaches Lin.

VICIOUS: What about him?

SHIN: He got away. All our men were defeated, we ran out of weapons and
lost all means to -

VICIOUS: Why did you come back? Where is Julia?

Shin hesitates.

SHIN: I don't know...

VICIOUS: Shin. Don't follow in Lin's footsteps.


The rainy streets of Mars. Julia and Spike ride in her red convertible.

SPIKE: Keep going, and pass the place.

JULIA: What?

SPIKE: Someone might have gotten here already.

They pass Annie's store and stop a block away from it.

SPIKE: Wait here.


Annie's store. Spike enters.

SPIKE: Annie...?

Annie is sitting on a bench, holding a bleeding wound, dying. She struggles
to speak.

ANNIE: I told them that you weren't here. That you were already dead. I
told them -

SPIKE: Don't talk.

ANNIE: Vicious killed off the elders, they said. Everyone has lost sense of
where they want to be... Just like kites with no strings.

Julia enters.

ANNIE: I see... you were able to meet Julia... I'm glad...

JULIA: Annie!

ANNIE: It's... rather chilly... today...

Annie slips away. Julia covers her with her coat.


Spike retrieves artillery from the back shelf.

JULIA: You don't need weapons like that just to run away...

Spike is silent.

JULIA: You're going to go... I'll go with you. Until the very end, I'll be
with you.

SPIKE: I'm sorry. I'm gonna make a bit of a scene.


The Bebop. Downed somewhere barren on Mars.

JET: You sure are a lucky woman.

FAYE: Really. I came back just at the right time, and got involved in just
the right way. I really am lucky.

JET: The Red Tail won't be mobile for a while.

FAYE: You're doing pretty well yourself... Getting the short end of the
stick and all. He's probably not coming back, you know that? He might
have been offed somewhere already.

JET: Maybe so. But, so what? Do you want me to go looking for him? You've
got to be kidding! He went off to do away with his past!

FAYE: You made him go.

Jet grabs Faye by the collar of her outfit.

JET: My leg was shot, my ship is busted! Hell, yeah! He was nothing but
trouble! Like I care!

Jet lets go. They turn away from each other. Both are silent for a moment.

JET: So what kind of a woman was Julia?

FAYE: A normal woman... A beautiful, dangerous but normal woman that you
can't leave alone...

JET: I see.

FAYE: Like a devilish angel... or maybe an angelic devil...


The street. Julia's convertible explodes.

Annie's store. Gunfire enters from the outside. Spike shoots a thug and
runs up the stairs to the roof.

SPIKE: This way!

Julia follows, turns and guns down another thug.

On the roof, Spike spots a thug on the roof of the neighboring building.

SPIKE: Get down!

Julia ducks. Spike kills the thug. Julia stands up. Another thug shoots
her a split-second before Spike kills him. Julia falls.

SPIKE: Julia!

Spike runs to Julia and holds her in his arms.

SPIKE: Hey!

Julia speaks her final words to Spike. Spike turns his head up, looking
deep into the rainy sky.


Laughing Bull's tent, somewhere on Mars.

JET: Where is Spike now?

BULL: All organisms... All beings with life all have their own stars. The
moment a new life is born a new star is born and becomes the guardian
star. This star we stand on is someone's guardian star as well. That
red star, that blue star... When a life ends, the star falls, and
disappears.

JET: Please don't say that.

BULL: Running Rock.

JET: Don't call me by such a name!

BULL: His star is about to fall.

JET: This is stupid. I can't believe it.

BULL: Do not fear death. Death is always at your side. When you show fear,
it will spring at you faster than light. If you do not show fear,
it will only gently look over you...


EYECATCH


Annie's store. A thug presents Julia's coat to Vicious.

THUG: Sir Vicious, I found this. The woman's passport is inside it as well.
Surely she cannot escape from this planet easily.

VICIOUS: A beast that has lost a place to go... He has nowhere to return to
now. He will come.


The Bebop. Jet awakes from a nap on the couch and sees Spike.

JET: Spike, you...

Spike smiles.

SPIKE: Do you have anything to eat? I'm starving.


Jet serves up a plate of bell peppers.

SPIKE: The food you cook tastes horrible, as usual.

JET: For that, you sure are eating a lot.

SPIKE: Hunger is the best spice, they say.

Spike finishes the meal.

SPIKE: Do you know a story that goes like this? There once was a tiger-
striped cat. This cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million
times and was owned by various people who he didn't care for. The
cat wasn't afraid to die... One day, the cat was a free cat, a stray
cat. He met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days
happily together. Years passed, and the white cat died of old age.
The tiger-striped cat cried a million times, and then died. It never
came back to life...

JET: That's a good story...

SPIKE: I hate that story. I hate cats.

JET: That's what I thought.

The two laugh for a good while. Spike gets up and begins to walk away.

JET: Spike. Can I ask you one thing?

Spike stops.

SPIKE: What?

JET: Is it for the woman?

SPIKE: There is nothing I can do for a dead woman.

Spike continues into the hallway. Faye points a gun at his head.

FAYE: Where are you going? Why are you going? You told me once... that the
past didn't matter... You're the one who's tied to their past!

Spike leans close to Faye and stares straight into her eyes.

SPIKE: Look at these eyes. One of them is a fake, because I lost it in an
accident. Since then, I have been seeing the past in one eye, and
the present in the other. I had believed that what I saw was not
all of reality...

FAYE: Don't tell me things like that... You never told me anything about
yourself! Don't tell me stuff like that now!

SPIKE: I thought I was watching a dream that I would never awaken from.
Before I knew it, the dream was all over.

Spike continues to walk away.

FAYE: My... memory came back.

Spike stops.

FAYE: But... nothing good came out of it. There was no place for me to
return to... This was the only place I could go back to! But now...
Where are you going?! Why do you have to go?! Are you telling me
you're going to just throw your life away?!

SPIKE: I'm not going there to die. I'm going there to see if I really am
alive.

Spike walks away. Faye fires all of her rounds into the air.


Mars. Red Dragon Headquarters. Spike enters and kills thugs left and right.
He rides the elevator as far as he could. Facing off against one thug, he
is shot in the gut. An elevator door opens and he spots Shin.

SPIKE: Shin! Where's Vicious?

SHIN: On the top floor. This way.

Shin leads him up. They turn a corner and Shin is shot by a thug.

SPIKE: Shin!

Spike kills the thug and goes to Shin.

SPIKE: Shin!

SHIN: Please defeat... Vicious... Actually... I wanted you to come back...

Shin dies.


Spike runs into the main chamber. He opens the door and the room explodes,
revealing the night sky. Vicious steps down from a large stairway.

VICIOUS: So you are finally awake. I told you before, Spike... that I am
the only one who can kill you.

SPIKE: I'll return those words back to you, Vicious.

VICIOUS: Eitherway, we were destined to end up like this.

Spike runs up the stairway and the two clash weapons. Vicious cuts Spike
twice and Spike shoots his katana out of his hand. Spike puts his hand on
the katana and Vicious puts his hand on the gun.

SPIKE: Julia passed away... Let's end it all.

VICIOUS: If that's your wish.

They exchange weapons. At the same time Spike shoots Vicious in the chest
and Vicious slashes Spike in the gut. Vicious falls. Blood spills from
Spike's gut. He looks up into the brightening and recalls. Julia's final
words.

JULIA: This is... a dream...

SPIKE: Yeah... Just a bad dream...


It is morning. Spike, clutching his bleeding gut, descends the stairway to
meets a legion of confused, baffled and surprised syndicate members. Spike
smiles and points his index finger at them. 

SPIKE: Bang...

Spike falls.
